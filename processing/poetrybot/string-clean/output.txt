a banana is an edible fruit botanically a berry produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus musa in some countries bananas used for cooking may be called plantains in contrast to dessert bananas the fruit is variable in size color and firmness but is usually elongated and curved with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind which may be green yellow red purple or brown when ripe the fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant almost all modern edible parthenocarpic seedless bananas come from two wild species musa acuminata and musa balbisiana the scientific names of most cultivated bananas are musa acuminata musa balbisiana and musa paradisiaca for the hybrid musa acuminata balbisiana depending on their genomic constitution the old scientific name musa sapientum is no longer used musa species are native to tropical indomalaya and australia and are likely to have been first domesticated in papua new guinea they are grown in countries primarily for their fruit and to a lesser extent to make fiber banana wine and banana beer and as ornamental plants the world largest producers of bananas in were india and china which together accounted for of total production worldwide there is no sharp distinction between bananas and plantains especially in the americas and europe banana usually refers to soft sweet dessert bananas particularly those of the cavendish group which are the main exports from countries by contrast musa cultivars with firmer starchier fruit are called plantains in other regions such as southeast asia many more kinds of banana are grown and eaten so the binary distinction is not useful and is not made in local languages the term banana is also used as the common name for the plants that produce the fruit this can extend to other members of the genus musa such as the scarlet banana musa coccinea the pink banana musa velutina and the bananas it can also refer to members of the genus ensete such as the snow banana ensete glaucum and the economically important false banana ensete ventricosum both genera are in the banana family musaceae the banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant all the parts of a banana plant grow from a structure usually called a corm plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy and are often mistaken for trees but what appears to be a trunk is actually a false stem or pseudostem bananas grow in a wide variety of soils as long as the soil is at least cm deep has good drainage and is not compacted the leaves of banana plants are composed of a stalk petiole and a blade lamina the base of the petiole widens to form a sheath the tightly packed sheaths make up the pseudostem which is all that supports the plant the edges of the sheath meet when it is first produced making it tubular as new growth occurs in the centre of the pseudostem the edges are forced apart cultivated banana plants vary in height depending on the variety and growing conditions most are around m ft tall with a range from cavendish plants at around m ft to michel at m ft or more leaves are spirally arranged and may grow metres ft long and cm ft wide they are easily torn by the wind resulting in the familiar frond look when a banana plant is mature the corm stops producing new leaves and begins to form a flower spike or inflorescence a stem develops which grows up inside the pseudostem carrying the immature inflorescence until eventually it emerges at the top each pseudostem normally produces a single inflorescence also known as the banana heart more are sometimes produced an exceptional plant in the philippines produced five after fruiting the pseudostem dies but offshoots will normally have developed from the base so that the plant as a whole is perennial in the plantation system of cultivation only one of the offshoots will be allowed to develop in order to maintain spacing the inflorescence contains many bracts sometimes incorrectly referred to as petals between rows of flowers the female flowers which can develop into fruit appear in rows further up the stem closer to the leaves from the rows of male flowers the ovary is inferior meaning that the tiny petals and other flower parts appear at the tip of the ovary the banana fruits develop from the banana heart in a large hanging cluster made up of tiers called hands with up to fruit to a tier the hanging cluster is known as a bunch comprising tiers or commercially as a banana stem and can weigh kilograms lb individual banana fruits commonly known as a banana or finger average grams lb of which approximately is water and dry matter nutrient table lower right the fruit has been described as a leathery berry there is a protective outer layer a peel or skin with numerous long thin strings the phloem bundles which run lengthwise between the skin and the edible inner portion the inner part of the common yellow dessert variety can be split lengthwise into three sections that correspond to the inner portions of the three carpels by manually deforming the unopened fruit in cultivated varieties the seeds are diminished nearly to their remnants are tiny black specks in the interior of the fruit bananas are naturally slightly radioactive more so than most other fruits because of their potassium content and the small amounts of the isotope found in naturally occurring potassium the banana equivalent dose of radiation is sometimes used in nuclear communication to compare radiation levels and exposures the word banana is thought to be of west african origin possibly from the wolof word banaana and passed into english via spanish or portuguese the genus musa was created by carl linnaeus in the name may be derived from antonius musa physician to the emperor augustus or linnaeus may have adapted the arabic word for banana mauz the old biological name musa sapientum muse of the wise arose because of homophony in latin with the classical muses musa is in the family musaceae the apg iii system assigns musaceae to the order zingiberales part of the commelinid clade of the monocotyledonous flowering plants some species of musa were recognized by the world checklist of selected plant families as of january update several produce edible fruit while others are cultivated as ornamentals the classification of cultivated bananas has long been a problematic issue for taxonomists linnaeus originally placed bananas into two species based only on their uses as food musa sapientum for dessert bananas and musa paradisiaca for plantains more species names were added but this approach proved to be inadequate for the number of cultivars in the primary center of diversity of the genus southeast asia many of these cultivars were given names that were later discovered to be synonyms in a series of papers published from onwards ernest cheesman showed that linnaeus musa sapientum and musa paradisiaca were cultivars and descendants of two wild species musa acuminata and musa balbisiana both first described by luigi aloysius colla cheesman recommended the abolition of linnaeus species in favor of reclassifying bananas according to three morphologically distinct groups of cultivars those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of musa balbisiana those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of musa acuminata and those with characteristics of both researchers norman simmonds and ken shepherd proposed a nomenclature system in this system eliminated almost all the difficulties and inconsistencies of the earlier classification of bananas based on assigning scientific names to cultivated varieties despite this the original names are still recognized by some authorities today leading to confusion the accepted scientific names for most groups of cultivated bananas are musa acuminata colla and musa balbisiana colla for the ancestral species and musa paradisiaca for the hybrid acuminata m balbisiana synonyms of paradisica include generally modern classifications of banana cultivars follow simmonds and shepherd system cultivars are placed in groups based on the number of chromosomes they have and which species they are derived from thus the latundan banana is placed in the aab group showing that it is a triploid derived from both acuminata a and balbisiana b for a list of the cultivars classified under this system see list of banana cultivars in a team of scientists announced they had achieved a draft sequence of the genome of musa acuminata in regions such as north america and europe musa fruits offered for sale can be divided into bananas and plantains based on their intended use as food thus the banana producer and distributor chiquita produces publicity material for the american market which says that a plantain is not a banana the stated differences are that plantains are more starchy and less sweet they are eaten cooked rather than raw they have thicker skin which may be green yellow or black and they can be used at any stage of ripeness linnaeus made the same distinction between plantains and bananas when first naming two species of musa members of the plantain subgroup of banana cultivars most important as food in west africa and latin america correspond to the chiquita description having long pointed fruit they are described by ploetz et al as true plantains distinct from other cooking bananas the cooking bananas of east africa belong to a different group the east african highland bananas so would not qualify as true plantains on this definition an alternative approach divides bananas into dessert bananas and cooking bananas with plantains being one of the subgroups of cooking bananas triploid cultivars derived solely from acuminata are examples of dessert bananas whereas triploid cultivars derived from the hybrid between acuminata and balbinosa in particular the plantain subgroup of the aab group are plantains small farmers in colombia grow a much wider range of cultivars than large commercial plantations a study of these cultivars showed that they could be placed into at least three groups based on their characteristics dessert bananas cooking bananas and plantains although there were overlaps between dessert and cooking bananas in southeast asia the center of diversity for bananas both wild and cultivated the distinction between bananas and plantains does not work according to valmayor et al many bananas are used both raw and cooked there are starchy cooking bananas which are smaller than those eaten raw the range of colors sizes and shapes is far wider than in those grown or sold in africa europe or the americas southeast asian languages do not make the distinction between bananas and plantains that is made in english and spanish thus both cavendish cultivars the classic yellow dessert bananas and saba cultivars used mainly for cooking are called pisang in malaysia and indonesia kluai in thailand and chuoi in vietnam bananas grown and eaten in the islands of the pacific are derived from entirely different wild species than traditional bananas and plantains most bananas are cooked but karat bananas which are short and squat with bright red skins very different from the usual yellow dessert bananas are eaten raw in summary in commerce in europe and the americas although not in cultivation it is possible to distinguish between bananas which are eaten raw and plantains which are cooked in other regions of the world particularly india southeast asia and the islands of the pacific there are many more kinds of banana and the distinction is not useful and not made in local languages plantains are one of many kinds of cooking bananas which are not always distinct from dessert bananas farmers in southeast asia and papua new guinea first domesticated bananas recent archaeological and palaeoenvironmental evidence at kuk swamp in the western highlands province of papua new guinea suggests that banana cultivation there goes back to at least bce and possibly to bce it is likely that other species were later and independently domesticated elsewhere in southeast asia southeast asia is the region of primary diversity of the banana areas of secondary diversity are found in africa indicating a long history of banana cultivation in the region phytolith discoveries in cameroon dating to the first millennium bce triggered an as yet unresolved debate about the date of first cultivation in africa there is linguistic evidence that bananas were known in madagascar around that time the earliest prior evidence indicates that cultivation dates to no earlier than late century ce it is likely however that bananas were brought at least to madagascar if not to the east african coast during the phase of malagasy colonization of the island from south east asia ce the banana may also have been present in isolated locations elsewhere in the middle east on the eve of islam the spread of islam was followed by diffusion there are numerous references to it in islamic texts such as poems and hadiths beginning in the century by the century the banana appears in texts from palestine and egypt from there it diffused into north africa and muslim iberia during the medieval ages bananas from granada were considered among the best in the arab world in islamic conquerors brought the banana to palestine today banana consumption increases significantly in islamic countries during ramadan the month of daylight fasting bananas were certainly grown in the christian kingdom of cyprus by the late medieval period writing in the italian traveller and writer gabriele capodilista it wrote favourably of the extensive farm produce of the estates at episkopi near limassol including the region banana plantations bananas were introduced to the americas by portuguese sailors who brought the fruits from west africa in the century many wild banana species as well as cultivars exist in extraordinary diversity in india china and southeast asia there are fuzzy bananas whose skins are bubblegum pink striped bananas with pulp the color of orange sherbet bananas that when cooked taste like strawberries the double mahoi plant can produce two bunches at once the chinese name of the aromatic go san heong banana means can smell it from the next mountain the fingers on one banana plant grow fused another produces bunches of a thousand fingers each only an inch long in the and centuries portuguese colonists started banana plantations in the atlantic islands brazil and western africa north americans began consuming bananas on a small scale at very high prices shortly after the civil war though it was only in the that the food became more widespread as late as the victorian era bananas were not widely known in europe although they were available jules verne introduces bananas to his readers with detailed descriptions in around the world in eighty days the earliest modern plantations originated in jamaica and the related western caribbean zone including most of central america it involved the combination of modern transportation networks of steamships and railroads with the development of refrigeration that allowed more time between harvesting and ripening north american shippers like lorenzo dow baker and andrew preston the founders of the boston fruit company started this process in the but railroad builders like minor keith also participated eventually culminating in the giant corporations like today chiquita brands international and dole these companies were monopolistic vertically integrated meaning they controlled growing processing shipping and marketing and usually used political manipulation to build enclave economies economies that were internally virtually tax exempt and that contribute very little to the host economy their political maneuvers which gave rise to the term banana republic for states like honduras and guatemala included working with local elites and their rivalries to influence politics or playing the international interests of the united states especially during the cold war to keep the political climate favorable to their interests the vast majority of the world bananas today are cultivated for family consumption or for sale on local markets india is the world leader in this sort of production but many other asian and african countries where climate and soil conditions allow cultivation also host large populations of banana growers who sell at least some of their crop peasant sector banana growers produce for the world market in the caribbean however the windward islands are notable for the growing largely of cavendish bananas for an international market generally in europe but also in north america in the caribbean and especially in dominica where this sort of cultivation is widespread holdings are in the acre range in many cases the farmer earns additional money from other crops from engaging in labor outside the farm and from a share of the earnings of relatives living overseas this style of cultivation often was popular in the islands as bananas required little labor input and brought welcome extra income citation needed banana crops are vulnerable to destruction by high winds such as tropical storms or cyclones after the signing of the nafta agreements in the however the tide turned against peasant producers their costs of production were relatively high and the end of favorable tariff and other supports especially in the european economic community made it difficult for peasant producers to compete with bananas grown on large plantations by the firms like chiquita and dole not only did the large companies have access to cheap labor in the areas they worked but they were better able to afford modern agronomic advances such as fertilization the dollar banana produced by these concerns made the profit margins for peasant bananas unsustainable citation needed caribbean countries have sought to redress this problem by providing government supported agronomic services and helping to organize producers cooperatives they have also been supporters of the fair trade movement which seeks to balance the inequities in the world trade in commodities citation needed most farms supply local consumption cooking bananas represent a major food source and a major income source for smallhold farmers in east africa highland bananas are of greatest importance as a staple food crop in countries such as uganda burundi and rwanda per capita consumption has been estimated at kilograms lb per year the highest in the world citation needed all widely cultivated bananas today descend from the two wild bananas musa acuminata and musa balbisiana while the original wild bananas contained large seeds diploid or polyploid cultivars some being hybrids with tiny seeds are preferred for human raw fruit consumption these are propagated asexually from offshoots the plant is allowed to produce two shoots at a time a larger one for immediate fruiting and a smaller sucker or follower to produce fruit in months the life of a banana plantation is years or longer during which time the individual stools or planting sites may move slightly from their original positions as lateral rhizome formation dictates citation needed cultivated bananas are parthenocarpic the flesh of the fruit swells and ripens without its seeds being fertilized and developing lacking viable seeds propagation typically involves farmers removing and transplanting part of the underground stem called a corm usually this is done by carefully removing a sucker a vertical shoot that develops from the base of the banana pseudostem with some roots intact however small sympodial corms representing not yet elongated suckers are easier to transplant and can be left out of the ground for up to two weeks they require minimal care and can be shipped in bulk citation needed it is not necessary to include the corm or root structure to propagate bananas severed suckers without root material can be propagated in damp sand although this takes somewhat longer citation needed in some countries commercial propagation occurs by means of tissue culture this method is preferred since it ensures planting material when using vegetative parts such as suckers for propagation there is a risk of transmitting diseases especially the devastating panama disease citation needed as a crop bananas are available fresh in global commerce in by far the most important cultivars belonged to the triploid aaa group of musa acuminata commonly referred to as cavendish group bananas they accounted for the majority of banana exports despite only coming into existence in the cultivars dwarf cavendish and grand nain chiquita banana gained popularity in the after the previous cultivar gros michel also an aaa group cultivar became commercially unviable due to panama disease caused by the fungus fusarium oxysporum which attacks the roots of the banana plant cavendish cultivars are resistant to the panama disease but in there were fears that the black sigatoka fungus would in turn make cavendish bananas unviable ease of transport and shelf life rather than superior taste make the dwarf cavendish the main export banana citation needed even though it is no longer viable for large scale cultivation gros michel is not extinct and is still grown in areas where panama disease is not found likewise dwarf cavendish and grand nain are in no danger of extinction but they may leave supermarket shelves if disease makes it impossible to supply the global market it is unclear if any existing cultivar can replace cavendish bananas so various hybridisation and genetic engineering programs are attempting to create a banana one such strain that has emerged is the taiwanese cavendish also known as the formosana export bananas are picked green and ripen in special rooms upon arrival in the destination country these rooms are and filled with ethylene gas to induce ripening the vivid yellow color consumers normally associate with supermarket bananas is in fact caused by the artificial ripening process flavor and texture are also affected by ripening temperature bananas are refrigerated to between and and during transport at lower temperatures ripening permanently stalls and the bananas turn gray as cell walls break down the skin of ripe bananas quickly blackens in the environment of a domestic refrigerator although the fruit inside remains unaffected cavendish bananas have a appearance which changes to a as they ripen further although both flavor and texture of bananas is generally regarded as superior to any type of fruit citation needed this reduces shelf life to only days citation needed bananas can be ordered by the retailer ungassed not treated with ethylene and may show up at the supermarket fully green guineos verdes green bananas that have not been gassed will never fully ripen before becoming rotten instead of fresh eating these bananas can be used for cooking as seen in jamaican cuisine a study reported that ripe bananas fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light this property is attributed to the degradation of chlorophyll leading to the accumulation of a fluorescent product in the skin of the fruit the chlorophyll breakdown product is stabilized by a propionate ester group leaves also fluoresce in the same way green bananas do not fluoresce the study suggested that this allows animals which can see light in the ultraviolet spectrum tetrachromats and pentachromats to more easily detect ripened bananas bananas must be transported over long distances from the tropics to world markets to obtain maximum shelf life harvest comes before the fruit is mature the fruit requires careful handling rapid transport to ports cooling and refrigerated shipping the goal is to prevent the bananas from producing their natural ripening agent ethylene this technology allows storage and transport for weeks at on arrival bananas are held at about and treated with a low concentration of ethylene after a few days the fruit begins to ripen and is distributed for final sale unripe bananas can not be held in home refrigerators because they suffer from the cold citation needed ripe bananas can be held for a few days at home if bananas are too green they can be put in a brown paper bag with an apple or tomato overnight to speed up the ripening process carbon dioxide which bananas produce and ethylene absorbents extend fruit life even at high temperatures this effect can be exploited by packing banana in a polyethylene bag and including an ethylene absorbent potassium permanganate on an inert carrier the bag is then sealed with a band or string this treatment has been shown to more than double lifespans up to weeks without the need for refrigeration in world production of bananas and plantains was million tonnes led by india and china with a combined total only for bananas of of global production table other major producers were the philippines ecuador indonesia and brazil together accounting for of the world total of bananas and plantains table as reported for total world exports were million tonnes of bananas and tonnes of plantains ecuador and the philippines were the leading exporters with and million tonnes respectively and the dominican republic was the leading exporter of plantains with tonnes bananas and plantains constitute a major staple food crop for millions of people in developing countries in most tropical countries green unripe bananas used for cooking represent the main cultivars most producers are farmers either for home consumption or local markets because bananas and plantains produce fruit they provide a valuable food source during the hunger season when the food from one harvest has been consumed and the next is still to come bananas and plantains are important for global food security while in no danger of outright extinction the most common edible banana cultivar cavendish extremely popular in europe and the americas could become unviable for cultivation in the next years its predecessor michel discovered in the suffered this fate like almost all bananas cavendish lacks genetic diversity which makes it vulnerable to diseases threatening both commercial cultivation and subsistence farming some commentators remarked that those variants which could replace what much of the world considers a typical banana are so different that most people would not consider them the same fruit and blame the decline of the banana on monogenetic cultivation driven by commercial motives panama disease is caused by a fusarium soil fungus race which enters the plants through the roots and travels with water into the trunk and leaves producing gels and gums that cut off the flow of water and nutrients causing the plant to wilt and exposing the rest of the plant to lethal amounts of sunlight prior to almost all commercial banana production centered on gros michel which was highly susceptible cavendish was chosen as the replacement for gros michel because among resistant cultivars it produces the highest quality fruit however more care is required for shipping the cavendish and its quality compared to gros michel is debated by whom citation needed according to current sources a deadly form of panama disease is infecting cavendish all plants are genetically identical which prevents evolution of disease resistance researchers are examining hundreds of wild varieties for resistance tropical race a reinvigorated strain of panama disease was first discovered in this virulent form of fusarium wilt has wiped out cavendish in several southeast asian countries it has yet to reach the americas however the fungi can easily be carried on boots clothing or tools this is how travels and will be its most likely route into latin america cavendish is highly susceptible to and over time cavendish will almost certainly be eliminated from commercial production by this disease the only known defense to is genetic resistance this is conferred either by a gene isolated from a diploid banana or by the black sigatoka is a fungal leaf spot disease first observed in fiji in or black sigatoka also known as black leaf streak has spread to banana plantations throughout the tropics from infected banana leaves that were used as packing material it affects all main cultivars of bananas and plantains including the cavendish cultivars impeding photosynthesis by blackening parts of the leaves eventually killing the entire leaf starved for energy fruit production falls by or more and the bananas that do grow ripen prematurely making them unsuitable for export the fungus has shown resistance to treatment with the current expense for treating hectare acres exceeding per year in addition to the expense there is the question of how long intensive spraying can be environmentally justified several resistant cultivars of banana have been developed but none has yet received commercial acceptance due to taste and texture issues citation needed with the arrival of black sigatoka banana production in eastern africa fell by over for example during the uganda produced to tonnes to long tons to short tons of bananas per hectare today production has fallen to only tonnes long tons short tons per hectare citation needed the situation has started to improve as new cultivars have been developed by the international institute of tropical agriculture and the national agricultural research organisation of uganda naro such as known in uganda as the kabana these new cultivars taste different from the cabana banana which has slowed their acceptance by local farmers however by adding mulch and manure to the soil around the base of the plant these new cultivars have substantially increased yields in the areas where they have been tried citation needed the international institute of tropical agriculture and naro funded by the rockefeller foundation and cgiar have started trials for genetically modified bananas that are resistant to both black sigatoka and banana weevils it is developing cultivars specifically for smallholder and subsistence farmers citation needed banana bunchy top virus bbtv jumps from plant to plant using aphids it stunts leaves resulting in a bunched appearance generally an infected plant does not produce fruit although mild strains exist which allow some production these mild strains are often mistaken for malnourishment or a disease other than bbtv there is no cure however its effect can be minimized by planting only plants in vitro propagation controlling aphids and immediately removing and destroying infected plants citation needed banana bacterial wilt bbw is a bacterial disease caused by xanthomonas campestris pv musacearum after being originally identified on a close relative of bananas ensete ventricosum in ethiopia in the bbw occurred in uganda in affecting all banana cultivars since then bbw has been diagnosed in central and east africa including the banana growing regions of rwanda the democratic republic of the congo tanzania kenya burundi and uganda raw bananas not including the peel are water carbohydrates protein and contain negligible fat table in a gram amount bananas supply calories and are a rich source of vitamin providing of the us recommended daily value and contain moderate amounts of vitamin c manganese and dietary fiber table bananas are a staple starch for many tropical populations depending upon cultivar and ripeness the flesh can vary in taste from starchy to sweet and texture from firm to mushy both the skin and inner part can be eaten raw or cooked the primary component of the aroma of fresh bananas is isoamyl acetate also known as banana oil which along with several other compounds such as butyl acetate and isobutyl acetate is a significant contributor to banana flavor during the ripening process bananas produce the gas ethylene which acts as a plant hormone and indirectly affects the flavor among other things ethylene stimulates the formation of amylase an enzyme that breaks down starch into sugar influencing the taste of bananas the greener less ripe bananas contain higher levels of starch and consequently have a starchier taste on the other hand yellow bananas taste sweeter due to higher sugar concentrations furthermore ethylene signals the production of pectinase an enzyme which breaks down the pectin between the cells of the banana causing the banana to soften as it ripens bananas are eaten deep fried baked in their skin in a split bamboo or steamed in glutinous rice wrapped in a banana leaf bananas can be made into jam banana pancakes are popular amongst backpackers and other travelers in south asia and southeast asia this has elicited the expression banana pancake trail for those places in asia that cater to this group of travelers banana chips are a snack produced from sliced dehydrated or fried banana or plantain which have a dark brown color and an intense banana taste dried bananas are also ground to make banana flour extracting juice is difficult because when a banana is compressed it simply turns to pulp bananas feature prominently in philippine cuisine being part of traditional dishes and desserts like maruya turón and or saba con yelo most of these dishes use the saba or cardaba banana cultivar bananas are also commonly used in cuisine in the state of kerala where they are steamed puzhungiyathu made into curries fried into chips upperi or fried in batter pazhampori pisang goreng bananas fried with batter similar to the filipino maruya or kerala pazhampori is a popular dessert in malaysia singapore and indonesia a similar dish is known in the united kingdom and united states as banana fritters plantains are used in various stews and curries or cooked baked or mashed in much the same way as potatoes such as the pazham pachadi dish prepared in kerala seeded bananas musa balbisiana one of the forerunners of the common domesticated banana are sold in markets in indonesia citation needed banana hearts are used as a vegetable in south asian and southeast asian cuisine either raw or steamed with dips or cooked in soups curries and fried foods the flavor resembles that of artichoke as with artichokes both the fleshy part of the bracts and the heart are edible banana leaves are large flexible and waterproof they are often used as ecologically friendly disposable food containers or as plates in south asia and several southeast asian countries in indonesian cuisine banana leaf is employed in cooking method called pepes and botok the banana leaf packages containing food ingredients and spices are cooked on steam in boiled water or grilled on charcoal in the south indian states of tamil nadu karnataka andhra pradesh and kerala in every occasion the food must be served in a banana leaf and as a part of the food a banana is served steamed with dishes they impart a subtle sweet flavor they often serve as a wrapping for grilling food the leaves contain the juices protect food from burning and add a subtle flavor in tamil nadu india leaves are fully dried and used as packing material for food stuffs and also making cups to hold liquid foods in central american countries banana leaves are often used as wrappers for tamales citation needed the tender core of the banana plant trunk is also used in south asian and southeast asian cuisine and notably in the burmese dish mohinga banana fiber harvested from the pseudostems and leaves of the plant has been used for textiles in asia since at least the century both and fibrous varieties of the banana plant have been used in the japanese system leaves and shoots are cut from the plant periodically to ensure softness harvested shoots are first boiled in lye to prepare fibers for these banana shoots produce fibers of varying degrees of softness yielding yarns and textiles with differing qualities for specific uses for example the outermost fibers of the shoots are the coarsest and are suitable for tablecloths while the softest innermost fibers are desirable for kimono and kamishimo this traditional japanese process requires many steps all performed by hand in a nepalese system the trunk is harvested instead and small pieces are subjected to a softening process mechanical fiber extraction bleaching and drying after that the fibers are sent to the kathmandu valley for use in rugs with a texture these banana fiber rugs are woven by traditional nepalese methods and are sold rugmark certified citation needed in south indian state of tamil nadu after harvesting for fruit the trunk outer layer of the shoot is made into fine thread used in making of flower garlands instead of thread citation needed in india a banana fiber separator machine has been developed which takes the agricultural waste of local banana harvests and extracts strands of the fiber banana fiber is used in the production of banana paper banana paper is made from two different parts the bark of the banana plant mainly used for artistic purposes or from the fibers of the stem and fruits the paper

world food crops in monetary value americans consume more bananas than apples and oranges combined with the world consuming so many bananas it not surprising that people are asking the question are bananas good for you this article will take a look at the potential health benefits of bananas such as improving heart health and promoting regularity it also examines the possible health risks associated with them listed below are the possible health benefits associated with bananas it is important to note that more high quality studies are required before these health benefit links are proved definitive maintaining a low sodium intake is essential to lowering blood pressure however increasing potassium intake may be just as important because of its vasodilation effects according to the national health and nutrition examination survey fewer than of us adults meet the daily mg recommendation also of note a high potassium intake is associated with a decreased risk of dying from all a study conducted by the imperial college of london found that children who ate just one banana per day had a less chance of developing asthma consuming bananas oranges and orange juice in the first two years of life may reduce the risk of developing childhood leukemia as a good source of vitamin c bananas can help combat the formation of free radicals known to cause cancer high fiber intakes from fruits and vegetables like bananas are associated with a lowered risk of colorectal cancer the fiber potassium vitamin c and content in bananas all support heart health an increase in potassium intake along with a decrease in sodium intake is the most important dietary change that a person can make to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease according to mark houston md ms an associate clinical professor of medicine at vanderbilt medical school and director of the hypertension institute at st thomas hospital in in one study those who consumed mg of potassium per day had a lower risk of death from ischemic heart disease compared with those who consumed less potassium about mg per day high potassium intakes are also associated with a reduced risk of stroke protection against loss of muscle mass preservation of bone mineral density and reduction in the formation of kidney studies have shown that type diabetics who consume diets have lower blood glucose levels and type diabetics may have improved blood sugar lipids and insulin levels one medium banana provides about grams of fiber the dietary guidelines for americans recommends for women and for men bland foods such as apple sauce and bananas are recommended for diarrhea treatment they are part of an approach known as the brat diet this stands for bananas rice applesauce and toast electrolytes like potassium are lost in large quantities during bouts of diarrhea and may make those affected feel weak bananas can replace these lost nutrients bananas can also help to promote regularity and replenish potassium stores bananas also contain tryptophan an amino acid that studies suggest plays a role in preserving memory and boosting your mood bananas are rich in a mineral called potassium this mineral is important as it helps maintain fluid levels in the body and regulates the movement of nutrients and waste products in and out of cells potassium also helps muscles to contract and nerve cells to respond it keeps the heart beating regularly and can reduce the effect of sodium on blood pressure potassium may reduce the risk of kidney stones forming as people age in turn healthy kidneys make sure that the right amount of potassium is kept in the body one banana contains milligrams of potassium it is best to try to get potassium from dietary sources such as bananas otherwise potassium supplements are available to purchase online one serving of banana is considered to be about grams one serving of banana contains calories grams of carbohydrate and gram of protein bananas are naturally free of fat cholesterol and bananas provide a variety of vitamins and minerals the recommended intake of potassium for adults is milligrams per day fresh bananas are available unlike other fruits the ripening process of bananas does not slow down after they are picked bananas should be stored at room temperature the warmer the temperature the faster bananas will ripen however to slow ripening bananas should be refrigerated the outer peel of the banana will darken but the banana itself will stay intact longer to encourage faster ripening place the banana in a brown paper bag at room in a popular diet fad known as the morning banana diet recommended eating a banana in the morning along with water eating a normal lunch and having dinner before add a sliced banana to your morning cereal or oatmeal for a more nutritious breakfast like apple sauce ripe mashed bananas can be used in baked goods to replace oil or butter mashed bananas lend a moist naturally sweet flavor to muffins cookies and cakes peel and freeze bananas for a great addition to any smoothie add sliced banana to your morning cereal or oatmeal or take a banana with you on your way to work or school for a healthy portable snack a type of medication most commonly prescribed for heart disease can cause potassium levels to increase in the blood high potassium foods such as bananas should be consumed in moderation when taking consuming too much potassium can be harmful for those whose kidneys are not fully functional if your kidneys are unable to remove excess potassium from the blood it could be fatal peter gelfand who practices internal medicine in long beach ny says certain medications used for heart disease and hypertension have the potential to increase potassium levels examples include certain such as labetalol medications that work by blocking the actions of the hormone aldosterone such as lisinopril and losartan and certain diuretics like spironolactone and eplerenone this is a partial list only and you should consult with your doctor if potassium levels become a concern some people may have an allergy to bananas if anyone with a banana allergy eats a banana they may experience symptoms in the mouth and throat such as itching hives swelling and wheezing bananas may trigger migraines in some people people who often experience migraine headaches are advised to eat no more than half a

loss aside from being very nutritious they are also a highly convenient snack food here are health benefits of bananas that are supported by scientific research bananas are among the most popular fruits on earth native to southeast asia they are now grown in many warmer parts of the world there are many types of bananas available which vary in color size and shape the most common type is the yellow banana which is green when unripe bananas contain a fair amount of fiber as well as several antioxidants one banana grams also contains each banana contains only about calories and consists almost exclusively of water and carbs bananas contain very little protein and almost no fat the carbs in unripe green bananas consist mostly of starch and resistant starch but as the banana ripens the starch turns into sugar glucose fructose and sucrose bananas are rich in a fiber called pectin which gives the flesh its structural form unripe bananas contain resistant starch which acts like soluble fiber and escapes digestion both pectin and resistant starch may moderate blood sugar levels after meals and reduce appetite by slowing stomach emptying furthermore bananas also rank low to medium on the glycemic index which is a measure from of how quickly foods increase blood sugar levels the glycemic value of unripe bananas is about while ripe bananas rank at about the average value of all bananas is this means that bananas should not cause major spikes in blood sugar levels in healthy individuals however this may not apply to diabetics which should probably avoid eating lots of bananas and monitor their blood sugars carefully when they do dietary fiber has been linked to many health benefits including improved digestion a banana contains about grams of fiber making bananas a fairly good fiber source bananas contain mainly two types of fiber resistant starch escapes digestion and ends up in our large intestine where it becomes food for the beneficial gut bacteria additionally some cell studies propose that pectin may help protect against colon cancer no study has directly tested the effects of bananas on weight loss however bananas do have several features that should make them a weight loss friendly food for starters bananas contain relatively few calories an average banana contains just over calories yet it is also very nutritious and filling they are also rich in fiber eating more fiber from fruit and vegetables has repeatedly been linked with lower body weight and weight loss furthermore unripe bananas are packed with resistant starch so they tend to be very filling and may reduce your appetite potassium is a mineral that is essential for heart health especially blood pressure control yet despite its importance most people are not getting enough potassium in their diet bananas are a great dietary source of potassium one banana grams contains of the rdi a diet can help lower blood pressure and people who eat plenty of potassium have up to a lower risk of heart disease furthermore bananas contain a decent amount of magnesium which is also important for heart health fruits and vegetables are excellent sources of dietary antioxidants and bananas are no exception they contain several types of potent antioxidants including dopamine and catechins these antioxidants have been linked to many health benefits such as a reduced risk of heart disease and degenerative diseases however it is a common misunderstanding that the dopamine from bananas acts as a chemical in the brain in reality dopamine from bananas does not cross the barrier it simply acts as a strong antioxidant instead of altering hormones or mood resistant starch is a type of indigestible carbohydrate found in unripe bananas which functions sort of like soluble fiber in the body as a rule of thumb you can estimate that the greener the banana is the higher the amount of resistant starch it contains on the other hand ripe yellow bananas contain lower amounts of resistant starch and total fiber but proportionally higher amounts of soluble fiber both pectin and resistant starch have been shown to have effects and increase the feeling of fullness after meals insulin resistance is a major risk factor for many of the world most serious diseases including type diabetes several studies have shown that grams of resistant starch per day may improve insulin sensitivity by in as little as weeks unripe bananas are a great source of resistant starch and may therefore help improve insulin sensitivity however the reason for these effects is not well understood and not all studies agree on the matter potassium is essential for blood pressure control and healthy kidney function as a good dietary source of potassium bananas may be especially beneficial for maintaining healthy kidneys one study in women showed that over years those who ate bananas times per week were less likely to develop kidney disease other studies have found that those who eat bananas times a week are almost less likely to develop kidney disease compared to people who do eat bananas bananas are often referred to as the perfect food for athletes largely due to their mineral content and easily digested carbs eating bananas may help reduce muscle cramps and soreness which affect up to of the general population the reason for the cramps is basically unknown but a popular theory blames a mixture of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance however studies have provided mixed findings about bananas and muscle cramps some find them helpful while others find no effects that being said bananas have been shown to provide excellent nutrition before during and after endurance exercise not only are bananas incredibly healthy they also one of the most convenient snack foods around bananas make a great addition to your breakfast yogurt cereal or smoothie you can even use them instead of sugar in your baking and cooking furthermore bananas rarely contain any pesticides or pollutants due to their thick protective peel bananas are incredibly easy to eat and transport they are usually and easily digested and simply have to be peeled and eaten it does get much easier than that an nutrition article from our experts at authority nutrition bananas are nutritious but also high in sugar and carbs do bananas make you fat or are they actually weight loss friendly foods this this is a detailed article about bananas what they are what they look like along with information on nutrition and health benefits potassium helps regulate critical body functions and a diet is linked to health benefits here a review of potassium and what bananas are great for any diet inexpensive packed with nutrients and enjoyable in many ways read more on their health benefits fruits are very nutritious and contain lots of fiber and antioxidants however some people think they can be harmful because of the sugar in them can you eat bananas if you have diabetes bananas do contain carbs that can raise blood sugar but they also have fiber and beneficial nutrients despite being perceived as healthy fruit juice is very similar to a beverage it is just as high in sugar and calories bananas contain many beneficial nutrients but they are also high in carbs and sugar this article reviews the health effects of bananas fruit is linked to many health benefits but it contains sugar leading many to question its effects on weight loss this article gets to the this is a detailed article about dried fruit and its health effects dried fruit is very nutritious but also contains a lot of sugar and calories bananas are one of the world most appealing fruits global banana exports reached about million tons in according to the united nations about half of them went to the united states and the european market in the united states each person eats lbs of bananas per year according to the department of agriculture making it americans favorite fresh fruit a wide variety of health benefits are associated with the curvy yellow fruit bananas are high in potassium and pectin a form of fiber said laura flores a san nutritionist they can also be a good way to get magnesium and vitamins c and bananas are known to reduce swelling protect against developing diabetes aid in weight loss strengthen the nervous system and help with production of white blood cells all due to the high level of vitamin that bananas contain flores told live science bananas are high in antioxidants which can provide protection from free radicals which we come into contact with every day from the sunlight to the lotion you put on your skin flores added a published by prilozi section of medical sciences suggested that unripe green bananas offer some health benefits they may help with controlling gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea and ulcers and may lower cholesterol and blood pressure some studies have suggested that the lectins in green bananas could provide treatment for hiv patients at the other end of a banana life research has shown that the levels of nutrients rise in bananas as they ripen bananas with dark spots were eight times more effective in enhancing the power of white blood cells than bananas according to a study published in food science and technology research white blood cells fight infections from bacteria fungi viruses and other pathogens here are the nutrition facts for bananas according to the food and drug administration which regulates food labeling through the national labeling and education act nutrition facts serving size medium banana oz g calories calories from fat daily values dv are based on a calorie diet heart health bananas are good for your heart they are packed with potassium a mineral electrolyte that keeps electricity flowing throughout your body which is required to keep your heart beating bananas high potassium and low sodium content may also help protect your cardiovascular system against high blood pressure according to the fda a animal study conducted by researchers at the university of alabama found that the potassium in bananas is also linked to arterial effectiveness the more potassium you have the less likely your arteries are to harden in the study mice with diet had harder arteries than mice consuming a normal amount of potassium arterial stiffness in humans is linked to heart disease depression and mood bananas can be helpful in overcoming depression due to high levels of tryptophan which the body converts to serotonin the brain neurotransmitter flores said plus vitamin can help you sleep well and magnesium helps to relax muscles additionally the tryptophan in bananas is well known for its properties digestion and weight loss bananas are high in fiber which can help keep you regular one banana can provide nearly percent of your daily fiber requirement vitamin can also help protect against type diabetes and aid in weight loss according to flores in general bananas are a great weight loss food because they taste sweet and are filling which helps curb cravings bananas are particularly high in resistant starch a form of dietary fiber in which researchers have recently become interested a review published in nutrition bulletin found that the resistant starch in bananas may support gut health and control blood sugar resistant starch increases the production of short chain fatty acids in the gut which are necessary to gut health exercise for replenishing energy and electrolytes bananas can be more effective than sports drinks a study published in plos one looked at male athletes competing in cycling races they compared athletes refueling with gatorade every minutes to athletes refueling with a banana and water researchers saw that the athletes performance times and body physiology were the same in both cases but the banana serotonin and dopamine improved the athletes antioxidant capacity and helped with oxidative stress improving performance overall vision carrots may get all the glory for helping your eyes but bananas do their share as well the fruits contain a small but significant amount of vitamin a which is essential for protecting your eyes maintaining normal vision and improving vision at night according to the national institutes of health vitamin a contains compounds that preserve the membranes around your eyes and are an element in the proteins that bring light to your corneas like other fruits bananas can help prevent macular degeneration an incurable condition which blurs central vision bones bananas may not be overflowing with calcium but they are still helpful in keeping bones strong according to a article in the journal of physiology and biochemistry bananas contain an abundance of fructooligosaccharides these are nondigestive carbohydrates that encourage priobotics and enhance the body ability to absorb calcium cancer some evidence suggests that moderate consumption of bananas may be protective against kidney cancer a swedish study found that women who ate more than servings of fruits and vegetables cut their risk of kidney cancer by percent and that bananas were especially effective women eating four to six bananas a week halved their risk of developing kidney cancer bananas may be helpful in preventing kidney cancer because of their high levels of antioxidant phenolic compounds pregnancy while not exactly a health benefit a study published by the royal society found that the potassium in bananas is correlated with women giving birth to baby boys the study looked at women and saw that those who consumed high levels of potassium prior to conception were more likely to have a boy that those who did not bananas may also help prevent gestational diabetes lack of sleep during pregnancy can contribute to gestational diabetes according to a published in sleep medicine reviews but the magnesium and tryptophan in bananas can help ensure a good night rest eaten in moderation there are no significant side effects associated with eating bananas however eating the fruits in excess may trigger headaches and sleepiness flores said she said that such headaches are caused by the amino acids in bananas that dilate blood vessels overripe bananas contain more of these amino acids than other bananas bananas can also contribute to sleepiness when eaten in excess due to the high amount of tryptophan found in them she said magnesium also relaxes the muscles another bananas are a sugary fruit so eating too many and not maintaining proper dental hygiene practices can lead to tooth decay they also do not contain enough fat or protein to be a healthy meal on their own or an effective snack eating bananas becomes significantly risky only if you eat too many the usda recommends that adults eat about two cups of fruit a day or about two bananas if you eat dozens of bananas every day there may be a risk of excessively high vitamin and mineral levels the university of maryland medical center reported that potassium overconsumption can lead to hyperkalemia which is characterized by muscle weakness temporary paralysis and an irregular heartbeat it can have serious consequences but you would have to eat about bananas in a short time for any symptoms of hyperkalemia to occur according to the nih consuming more than milligrams of vitamin daily can possibly lead to nerve damage in the arms and legs you would have to eat thousands of bananas to reach that level of vitamin it turns out that the biggest risk from a banana peel might really be slipping on it banana peels are not poisonous in fact they edible and packed with nutrients banana peel is eaten in many parts of the world though it not very common in the west flores said it contains high amounts of vitamin and as well as magnesium and potassium it also contains some fiber and protein according to a article in the journal of applied biochemistry and biotechnology banana peels also have various bioactive compounds like polyphenols carotenoids and others it is important to carefully wash a banana peel before eating it due to the pesticides that may be sprayed in banana groves banana peels are usually served cooked boiled or fried though they can be eaten raw or put in a blender with other fruits they are not as sweet as banana flesh riper peels will be sweeter than unripe ones bananas may have been the world first cultivated fruit archaeologists have found evidence of banana cultivation in new guinea as far back as the banana plant is classified as an arborescent perennial herb and the banana itself is considered a berry a bunch of bananas is called a hand a single banana is a finger there are almost varieties of bananas according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao nearly all the bananas sold in stores are cloned from just one variety the cavendish banana plant originally native to southeast asia the cavendish replaced the gros michel after that variety was wiped out by fungus in the the gros michel reportedly was bigger had a longer shelf life and tasted better the cavendish are resistant to the fungus that killed off the gros michel but they are susceptible to another fungus and may face the same fate within the next years botanists say botanically there is no difference between plantains and bananas but in general use banana refers to the sweeter form of the fruit which is often eaten uncooked while plantain refers to a starchier fruit that is often cooked before eating ecuador is the leading producer of bananas worldwide followed by the philippines bananas are produced in other tropical and subtropical areas of asia africa and the americas as well as the canary islands and australia wild bananas grow throughout southeast asia but most are inedible for humans as they are studded with hard seeds in sheet music for a popular song titled yes we have no bananas sold upward of a thousand copies a day harry

advertisement phys ed by gretchen reynolds april a banana might reasonably replace sports drinks for those of us who rely on carbohydrates to fuel exercise and speed recovery according to a new study comparing the cellular effects of carbohydrates consumed during sports it found that a banana with its package provides comparable or greater and other benefits for athletes than sports drinks but there may be a downside and it involves bloating for decades athletes and their advisers have believed and studies have confirmed that eating or drinking carbohydrates during prolonged exertion can enable someone to continue for longer or at higher intensities and recover more quickly afterward than if he or she does not eat during the workout the carbohydrates rapidly fuel muscles lessening some of the physiological stress of working out and prompting less inflammation afterward advertisement the most digestible and portable form of carbohydrates is sugar whether glucose fructose or sucrose and for athletes this sugar frequently is provided through sports drinks advertisement but sports drinks are not a substance found in the natural world they are manufactured and can contain flavorings and chemicals that some people might wish to avoid so a few years ago researchers at the north carolina research campus of appalachian state university in kannapolis began to wonder about fruits as a healthier alternative to sports drinks during exercise most fruits including bananas are sugary and high in fructose fructose after all means fruit sugar but they also contain other natural substances that might have an impact on sport performance and recovery the researchers speculated in a preliminary experiment published in the scientists found that cyclists performed better during a strenuous bike ride if they had either a banana or a sports drink compared to only water they also developed lower levels of inflammation in their bodies afterward but that study had left many questions unanswered particularly about whether and how the carbohydrates might be aiding athletes recovery so for the new experiment which was published last month in plos one the researchers decided to use more sophisticated techniques to track molecular changes inside cyclists bodies dole foods which sells bananas partially funded both studies according to a statement in the study the company did not have any involvement in the study design data collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the advertisement the researchers asked competitive cyclists male and female to complete a grueling bike ride on several occasions at the campus performance lab during one ride they drank only water in the others they had water but also eight ounces of a sports drink or about half of a banana every minutes please verify you not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please you must select a newsletter to subscribe to view all new york times newsletters the scientists drew blood before the workout immediately after and at several additional points stretching out to hours later they then checked the blood for markers of inflammation and levels of hundreds of molecules known as metabolites that can change during and after exertion and signify how much stress the body feels they also isolated blood cells to look at the activity of certain genes involved in inflammation as they had expected the scientists found that swallowing only water resulted in relatively high levels of inflammatory markers in the riders blood these markers were much lower if the cyclists had consumed fruit or the sports drink the volunteers also showed metabolite profiles if they had had carbohydrates during their rides whether those calories had come from a bottle or a banana but there were differences in the activity of some genes in particular the scientists found that the riders blood cells produced less of a genetic precursor of an enzyme known as if they had eaten bananas during their workout this effect was not seen if they had drunk the sports drink or only water the enzyme prompts the production of prostaglandins which in turn intensify inflammation less of the genetic precursor in cells after a workout should mean less and reduced inflammation says david nieman the director of the human performance lab at appalachian state university and the study s lead author he points out that drugs such as ibuprofen work by inhibiting but until now researchers had not considered that bananas might perform comparably how the fruit manages to affect the cells gene expression after exercise is still not known however he says advertisement he and his colleagues also do not know whether half of a standard banana every minutes is the ideal amount of the fruit during exertion although it provided as many carbohydrates as in a cup of the sports drink it also resulted in quite a bit of bloating he says which might dampen some athletes enthusiasm he and his colleagues plan to explore those issues in future studies and also look into the effects of other fruits dates have even more sugar than bananas nieman says in the meantime he says for exercisers who might prefer a natural inexpensive and neatly packaged alternative to sports drinks bananas look pretty a version of this article appears in print on april on page of the new york edition with the headline bananas outwork sports drinks order today we re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think see more go to home page banana fruit of the genus musa of the family musaceae one of the fruit crops of the world the banana is grown in the tropics and though it is most widely consumed in those regions it is valued worldwide for its flavour nutritional value and availability throughout the year a ripe fruit contains as much as percent of carbohydrate mainly as sugar and is high in dietary fibre potassium manganese and vitamins and cavendish or dessert bananas are most commonly eaten fresh though they may be fried or mashed and chilled in pies or puddings they may also be used to flavour muffins cakes or breads cooking varieties or plantains are starchy rather than sweet and are grown extensively as a staple food source in tropical regions although cavendish bananas are by far the variety imported by nontropical countries plantain varieties account for about percent of all banana cultivation worldwide the banana plant is a gigantic herb that springs from an underground stem or rhizome to form a false trunk metres feet high this trunk is composed of the basal portions of leaf sheaths and is crowned with a rosette of to oblong to elliptic leaves that sometimes attain a length of metres feet and a breadth of cm inches a large flower spike carrying numerous yellowish flowers protected by large bracts emerges at the top of the false trunk and bends downward to become bunches of to individual fruits or fingers the individual fruits or bananas are grouped in clusters or hands of to after a plant has fruited it is cut down to the ground because each trunk produces only one bunch of fruit the dead trunk is replaced by others in the form of suckers or shoots which arise from the rhizome at roughly intervals the life of a single rhizome thus continues for many years and the weaker suckers that it sends up through the soil are periodically pruned while the stronger ones are allowed to grow into plants banana plants thrive naturally on deep loose soils in humid tropical climates and they are grown successfully under irrigation in such semiarid regions as southern jamaica suckers and divisions of the rhizome are used as planting material the first crop ripens within to months and thereafter fruit production is more or less continuous frequent pruning is required to remove surplus growth and prevent crowding in a banana plantation desirable commercial bunches of bananas consist of nine hands or more and weigh kg pounds three hundred or more such bunches may be produced annually on one acre of land and are harvested before they fully ripen on the plant for export the desired degree of maturity attained before harvest depends upon distance from market and type of transportation and ripening is frequently induced artificially after shipment by exposure to ethylene gas bananas are thought to have been first domesticated in southeast asia and their consumption is mentioned in early greek latin and arab writings alexander the great saw bananas on an expedition to india shortly after the discovery of america bananas were taken from the canary islands to the new world where they were first established in hispaniola and soon spread to other islands and the mainland cultivation increased until bananas became a staple foodstuff in many regions and in the century they began to appear in the markets of the united states although there are hundreds of varieties of bananas in cultivation their taxonomy has been contentious because of their ancient domestication sterility hybridization and the use of diverse common names to refer to the same variety as most cultivated varieties of bananas are either interspecific hybrids of musa acuminata and balbisiana or hybrids of the subspecies of acuminata a system has led to an overhaul of the nomenclature of domesticated bananas unlike most plants these varieties are identified by their ploidy number of sets of chromosomes and parent plant rather than traditional binomial designations a system of letters a b or ab represents the parent plant s with a given letter repeated to indicate the ploidy the popular cavendish for example is referred to as aaa dwarf cavendish where aaa signifies its triploidy three sets of chromosomes as well as its derivation from acuminata given that each banana variety is propagated clonally there is very little genetic diversity in the domesticated plants this makes bananas especially vulnerable to pests and diseases as a novel pathogen or pest could quickly decimate a variety if it were to exploit a genetic weakness among the clones indeed this very phenomenon occurred in the late with the gros michel dessert variety which had dominated the world s commercial banana business richer and sweeter than the modern cavendish the gros michel fell victim to an invading soil fungus that causes panama disease a form of fusarium wilt powerless to breed resistance into the sterile clones and unable to rid the soil of the fungus farmers were soon forced to abandon the gros michel in favour of the hardier cavendish although the cavendish has thus far been resistant to such a pestilent invasion its lack of genetic diversity leaves it equally vulnerable to evolving pathogens and pests indeed a strain of panama disease known as tropical race tr has been a threat to the cavendish since the and many scientists worry that the cavendish too will eventually go extinct we welcome suggested

whfoods meal plan wonderfully sweet with firm and creamy flesh bananas come prepackaged in their own yellow jackets and are available for harvest throughout the year the banana plant grows to feet and belongs to the musaceae family of plants along with plantains the cluster of fruits contain anywhere from to bananas with individual fruits grouped in bunches known as hands containing to bananas creamy rich and sweet bananas are a favorite food for everyone from infants to elders they could not be more convenient to enjoy and they are a good source of both vitamins and minerals as well as fiber a first type of cardiovascular benefit from bananas is related to their potassium content bananas are a good source of potassium an essential mineral for maintaining normal blood pressure and heart function since one banana contains a whopping mg of potassium the inclusion of bananas in your routine meal plan may help to prevent high blood pressure and protect against atherosclerosis the effectiveness of foods such as bananas in lowering blood pressure has been demonstrated by a number of studies for example researchers tracked over american male health professionals over four years to determine the effects of diet on blood pressure men who ate diets higher in foods as well as foods high in magnesium and cereal fiber had a substantially reduced risk of stroke we also seen numerous prospective clinical research trials showing substantial reductions of blood pressure in individuals eating the dash diet a second type of cardiovascular benefit from bananas involves their sterol content while bananas are a very food less than of their calories come from fat one type of fat that they do contain in small amounts are sterols like sitosterol campesterol and stigmasterol as these sterols look structurally similar to cholesterol they can block the absorption of dietary cholesterol by blocking absorption they help us keep our blood cholesterol levels in check a third type of cardiovascular benefit from bananas involves their fiber content at about grams per medium banana we rank bananas as a good source of fiber approximately of the fiber in bananas is fiber for one banana this amount translates into gram of soluble fiber per banana soluble fiber in food is a type of fiber especially associated with decreased risk of heart disease making regular intake of bananas a potentially helpful approach to lowering your heart disease risk bananas are a fascinating fruit in terms of their carbohydrate and sugar content even though bananas are a fruit that tastes quite sweet when grams of total receive a rating of low in their glycemic index gi value gi measures the impact of a food on our blood sugar this low gi value for bananas is most likely related to two of their qualities first as mentioned previously a banana contains about grams of total fiber fiber is a nutrient that helps regulate the speed of digestion and by keeping digestion conversion of carbohydrates to simple sugars and release of simple sugars from digesting foods also stays within their total fiber content bananas also contain pectins pectins are unique and complicated types of fiber some of the components in pectins are and others are not as bananas ripen their pectins increase and this increase is one of the key reasons why bananas become softer in texture as they ripen as their pectins increase so does their relative concentration of fructose in comparison to other sugars this increase in pectins and higher proportional fructose content helps normalize the rate of carbohydrate digestion and moderates the impact of banana consumption on our blood sugar the bottom line here are some surprisingly consequences for a fruit that might be casually dismissed as being too high in sugar to be similar to the importance of their pectins is the digestive importance of fructooligosaccharides fos in bananas fos are unique carbohydrates that are typically not broken down by enzymes in our digestive tract instead they move along through the digestive tract until they reach our lower intestine and get metabolized by bacteria this process helps maintain the balance of friendly bacteria for example bifidobacteria in our lower intestine and as a consequence it also supports our overall digestive health in one study involving female participants eating two bananas each day for two months led to significant increases in bifidobacteria along with these increased levels of bifidobacteria participants also experienced fewer gastrointestinal problems and more regular bowel function when compared to other women in the study who drank a beverage that did not contain any actual banana the unique mix of vitamins minerals and low glycemic carbohydrates in bananas has made them a favorite fruit among endurance athletes their easy portability low expense and great taste also help support their popularity in this exclusive group a study of distance cyclists found that eating the equivalent of about one half a banana every minutes of a race was just as good at keeping energy levels steady as drinking an equivalent amount of carbohydrate and minerals from a processed sports beverage bananas have long been valued by athletes for prevention of muscle cramps since bananas are a good source of potassium and since low potassium levels are known to contribute to risk of muscle cramps it is logical to think about the potassium content of bananas as being the reason for fewer muscle cramps after consumption of bananas there is actually
