Billions of people all struggling to fulfill seeming different agenda
But we all are in pursuit of one collective destiny
We all need just one
One dream
One day
One hour
One minute
One second
One moment.


To the children we call our future
Who have no shoes to put on their feet
Who have barely any food to eat
Who believe in some unreal hope
But still dare to dream
Wild and free.


Do not fear the past.
It is painful
but it is real
Blood was spilt and people died
but love and unity had survived.


It is not as you suppose, your lands,
your cars, your money, or your cities
I covet...
It is what gores me most,
that in my own house and in my very own home
you should eye me and all that's mine
with that practiced, long-drawn, insulting sneer.

This is what I am
empty sockets despairing of possessing of life
a mouth torn open in an anguished wound...
a body tattooed with wounds seen and unseen
from the harsh whipstrokes of slavery
tortured and magnificent
proud and mysterious
Africa from head to foot
This is what I am.

Like an arrested breath
when breathing makes silence imperfect
and the ear cannot differentiate
between the conspiratorial whispers and the winds singing.
... a twig in the courtyard snaps
and report of a gun is understood.

Africa, my Africa
Africa of proud warriors in ancestral savannahs....
Is this you, this back that is bent
This back that breaks under the weight of humiliation
This back trembling with red scars
And saying yes to the whip under the midday sun.....
That is Africa your Africa
That grows again patiently obstinately
And its fruit gradually acquires
The bitter taste of liberty.

Desolate
Your face gleams up
Beneath me in the dusk
Abandoned
A wounded dove
Helpless
Beneath the knife of love.

I thank you God for creating me black.
White is the colour for special occasions
Black the colour for every day
And I have carried the World since the dawn of time
And my laugh over the World, through the night creates
The Day.

The stars have departed
The sky in a monocle
Surveys the world under
The stars have departed
And I- Where am I? ?
Stretch, stretch O antennae,
To clutch at this hour,
Fulfilling each movement in a
Broken monody.


The echo burst in me
Like a great harmonic chord-
Violins of love and happy voices
The pagan trumpet blast
Swamping the lamentation of the horn
Then the heraldic drums
In slow crescendo rising
Crashed though my senses
Into a new present
Which is the future.


expect sadness
like
you expect rain.
both,
cleanse you.

you
not wanting me
was
the beginning of me
wanting myself
thank you

i don't pay attention to the
world ending.
it has ended for me
many times
and began again in the morning.

if
the ocean
can calm itself,
so can you.
we
are both
salt water
mixed with
air.

the
quietest.
simplest.
most
powerful.
revolution.
ever.

No might make them angry but it will make you free.

i bleed every month. but do not die. how am i not magic. the lie

Desire is the kind of thing that
eats you
and
leaves you starving.

there have been so many times
i have seen a man wanting to weep
but
instead
beat his heart until it was unconscious.

never
trust anyone
who says
they do not see color.
this means
to them,
you are invisible.


I am so poor before you. A grackle
whose colors are as good as a peacock's,
sometimes better in the full face of sun.
The love poem I meant to say
is lost. Instead, I swear an oath.
I curse like someone speaking
in a foreign language. Instead of leave
I say scourge. The proper word a chick's voice
still in its egg, a beak in a small crack.
Your blood is hot and flowing,
and the hinges of your heart's valves
allow traffic in all your heart's rooms.
Is that why the little kisses are not enough?
In your sigh there is the sound of water pouring
into a hot, empty kettle.
Let us have the same dream tonight, I say
and your smile is red glass in dim light.
I dream my front tooth is a crumbling pillar
and you are the entire city of sin, in collapse.
Instead of leave, you say raze. You are so poor
before me.
So let us paint the ocean instead.
We dip the brushes in a canvas that takes them
out of our hands. Now you are the grackle's tail
calling for eyes from the side of a road,
and I am the best room in your heart.

If Somali hail fell from the sky, it would be cardamom.
Sidewalks would release its scent under our heels, we would fill
burlap bags with it, odd grains of rice mingling in our tea.
There my father is the Lion of God
and not a man who talks about position,
not a man who remembers position.
There, lips smile for love
and hope sounds like the English need:
don't piss on my need, we say.
Trouble falls, a rock
down the narrow well of the throat.
Chest and bullet are twins
separated by a handsome jaw, a beauty mark.
There my brother is Victorious
and not the odd grain in the sieve of my father's heart.


i am writing for
the women
who were once girls
judging themselves
through the eyes
of souls
who couldn't comprehend
their light
i am writing for
the women
who stammered
just to speak
and
who forced themselves
into silence
when ugly words
were once thrown at them
i am writing for
the women
who keep kneeling
screaming at their phone
as lovers leave
as friends depart
i am writing for
all these women
who still
show up
with a smile
after battling their demons
the night before.
i am also writing
for the women
who do not smile
the next day,
the women who
need
a day or two
to recover
from the brutalities
of the world.


It is stronger than my reason,
it is stronger than my soul,
I am ashamed of it, but I can neither resist nor hide my disease.
This is why I am telling you my deadly secret.

You have beautiful flesh
You have beautiful legs
You have beautiful arms
All of you is beautiful
You have done beautiful things, you have done beautiful things, girl, you have done beautiful things

But then I'd say softer,
eyes bright with your seeing:
A gift, love. No words.
Come closer and
look, it's all me.

My dark-brown girl is like a cow,
My light-yellow girl is like Nimuene,
As beautiful as Schikuni or Ombago,*
As pretty as a delicately cut thong,
As hides round the loins of a royal servant.
When I wait for her, I can eat nothing,
When I expect her, I cannot sleep,
Sleep and food matter not to me then.
Her fingernails are white as if they were washed,
Her fingers, as if she had just touched fat.
She is as bright as the ombimbo-root,
Ombimbo, dug up by the Bushmen,
Ombimbo, grown in the sandy desert of Amambo,
Picked up at the root of the omusati-tree.
My girl is like a copper ring in looks,
My girl is serious, she does not laugh for nothing,
She does not laugh when we are with people,
She laughs only when we are alone together.
Each time I look into her face
It is as if the sun rose newly.
When I have to leave her
It is as if night came over me.
When she goes for water, help her,
When she treads grain, tread for her too,
When she goes to sow, sow for her too,
When she walks about, carry her!
O my Nehoja, you are my adornment!
All the young men offer you their beads.
My treasure is the most beautiful among all strings of beads,
She is like a delicately cut thong.
Her mother bore her for me.
Since she was born, she has belonged only to me.
I love her dearly even when I am asleep,
But when I am awake, a thousand times more.

Jinkono's Namujezi, Nascheja's grandchild,
Mpingana, a tree on the plain,
A palm-tree in the possession of Schinkonjo, Nepaka's son,
Belonged to our people of heroes. . . .
Namujezi, you flower from Jinkono's garden,
You plant too high to be reached!
Her noble figure is something to marvel at,
Her beauty turns the heads of the Aalombe,
The people of Jikokola are ravished too.
They run in their eagerness to give Namujezi gifts.
Namujezi's beauty is indescribable.
Jinkono's flower shines like a star.
I saw her from far away, before she came to us.
Namujezi, your eyes - how fresh-new they are!
And your teeth - as if you had gotten them only yesterday!
And your eyes - like those of a hornless cow!
Namujezi, open your eyes, clear as water;
Your teeth - just laugh, laugh out,
So that we may see them all and marvel at them.
We will let our game sleep
Until the morning star appears.
I will not leave the playground so long as Namujezi is there.
Where she is, the moon becomes the sun,
Night becomes bright day.
We are favorites of glorious night,
We are court servants of the moon.
Where you, Star-Namujezi, shine,
I will follow you, no matter where you go.
Well I know the signs of your passing.
Anyone knows Namujezi, even among many women.
She shines like the spring sun rising.
You say: "No one can eat beauty."
Yet I feed on Namujezi's.

Where has my love blown his horn?
The tune of his horn is well known.
Young men of my clan,
Have you heard the horn of my love?
The long distance has ruined me, oh!
The distance between me and my companion.
Youths of my clan,
Have you heard the horn of my love?
The shortage of cattle has ruined my man!
The poverty of my love!
You men of my clan,
Listen to the horn of my love.
Where has my love blown his horn?
The tune of his horn is well known.
Young men of my clan,
Listen to the horn of my clan.

I sleep long and soundly,
Suddenly the door creaks,
Confused, I open my eyes,
And find my love standing there:
What matters death to me?
It has been raining and raining,
It has been raining and raining,
I go out to leave my footprints:
I see the footprints of my love.
All footprints are not alike:
I go out to leave my footprints
And find the footprints of my love.
He has two loves, 
He has two loves,
I go to see him off.
I meet the other woman. 
I cannot go on,
I cannot go back,
I burst into tears.

I painted my eyes with black antimony
I girded myself with amulets.
I will satisfy my desire,
you my slender boy.
I walk behind the wall.
I have covered my bosom.
I shall knead colored clay
I shall paint the house of my friend,
O my slender boy.
I shall take my piece of silver
I will buy silk.
I will gird myself with amulets
I will satisfy my desire
the horn of antimony in my hand,
O my slender boy!

The seven maids opened their eyes wide
and silently looked at each other.
They were wondering whether a bad spirit
had entered their queen's soul
to steal her reserve and her reason.

The eight women stole away in the dark.
They arrived at the bottom of the wall
in a quiet, seldom watched place.
Saran unfolded the cotton roll
and made a strong and thick rope with it.
She climbed on the shoulders of one of her maids
and heaved herself on the top of the wall;
she then threw one end of the rope to her maids
and took hold of the other;
she let herself slide down the wall
like a bucket that is lowered into a well,
while her maids were counterbalancing her on the other side.
Saran landed with a few scratches,
she shook the rope and her maids pulled it up.
Three of them followed suit
and the remaining four stayed inside
to be on the lookout before the queen returned.

It was like a nightmare
When I heard that you had moved
I remained alone with my sorrow
Unresigned to the fact that you were so far away
Should we chance one day to meet again
Please do return my glance
So that among the girls I might still know you
My eyes shall surely remember yours
For you left me badly wounded
Yes, how could I forget you?
And if perchance you should forget me
Just question your heart and it will answer
One day I shall pass by your house
And your heart may remind you of my love
My heart has been broken
And you are the reason for its pain
You were the very first girl
That I ever knew in my life
Indeed you are the key
That opens my heart's desire
But you are also death itself
Since you thwarted my fate.

I want to feel the hotness of your flesh,
burn in the fire of desire.
I take no pleasure in dreading the unknown;
show me all;
show me the strength of your love
in your full nakedness.

One kiss of parting lovers
which only lasts a moment
will claim
a hundred nights of memories,
a thousand sighs,
as the restless soul searches
in the darkness of solitude,
One swift reunion of lovers
fulfilled in moments
will vanish
a thousand nights of sorrows,
a thousand tears,
as two open hearts
cease to bleed
locked in perfect union
this world forgotten,
as lovers embrace.

Strike the buffalo horn
with the branch of berrywood or munga tree.
Blast the ivory horn
that resounds in the Sultan's palace,
let its echo reverberate
with the force of the elephant's voice.
Broadcast the echo,
let it rouse the sleeping families,
the women and the men,
let them hurry here in crowds.
Assemble the noble ladies, the dignified daughters,
and let them be seated here;
let us blend our verses
in praise of the Arabian lady.
Let us blend our verses,
and scan them carefully,
cast away the chaff
and retain the good ones.
Let us pause here,
arrange and refine our verses
till they are concise enough
to praise her delightful features.
My kinsmen, listen:
I shall start with her head,
her soft-silken hair
long-flowing and supple.
This noble woman's head
is as smooth as alabaster,
and well rounded
like a perfect circle.
Her ears
as she listens
curve out perfectly
like the blade of an anchor.
This lady's face, I swear,
I have yet to see its peer,
is beautifully molded
and blooms with its radiance.
Her matching eyebrows
are perfectly parallel
and neatly join at the root
as if they are knotted together.
Pitch-black,
darker even than ink,
they have joined hands
like arching acacia branches.
Whether she closes
or opens her eyes,
her countenance always fills
whoever is present with fear.
What a wonder her nose is;
its holes are visible
and number six
for he who counts them.
But do not be amazed,
if you look carefully,
twenty stars
are in her pupils.
Her cheeks,
fresh as coconut flesh
that yields squeezed oil,
surpass all others.
Her lips are thin
even when they are loosely closed;
whatever she utters
is lucid even to a simpleton.
Her teeth are lightning,
whiter than ivory
and as brilliant
as the Arabian lights.
Her tongue is as fiery
as the flame of a lantern;
it is especially radiant
whenever she recites the Koran.
Her mouth exudes
fragrant whiffs of the musk
of the civet perfume
from the wild or tame civet cat.
Her chin is rare, wonderful,
better than an almond,
more delicious than a cooked almond,
the Arabian Muscat nut.
Her neck is as long
as a noble bamboo
adorned with necklaces
neatly strung together.
Her shoulders are smooth;
they don't jut out
like glasses,
but they curve round.
Her armpits, my brothers,
where methinks a perfume tree grew,
will ravish a man
who sets his eyes on them.
The aroma that it exudes
is sweeter than jasmine
or the more fragrant
aloe oil.
Oh how I desire
her coral-colored nipples,
pink like the inner flesh
of the pomegranate.
I have neither witnessed
nor have I ever seen
such divine fruits
as those of the Arabian Lady.
Even inside the cloth
they already command respect,
and when they are bared,
a man's senses wander about.
Her belly is a cushion of flesh,
pleasant folds and secret nooks;
her navel is a gem that she can
retract and close like a cameo.
Her navel is the bowl of a water-pipe
crafted in Mecca;
anyone who inhales its perfume
will go dizzy with desire.
Heavy are her hips,
perfect for the game of finger
in the ring that has a gem
that clamps an inserted finger.
The sweetness of this clamp!
Captain, mind your compass needle!
Even without touching it,
it will begin to grip and squeeze.
Her little pool of fire,
when I saw it,
is neither long nor wide,
and it is full of juice.
It was cloudy and cool
with a soft pleasant breeze;
I carefully rigged up my dhow
and readied it for the voyage.
I unfurled the mainsail
made from ten mats
and very subtly
I pressed the bowsprit forward.
I turned the helm
and fitted the rudder;
I felt its strong pull in the water
as it glided towards Arabia.
So I entered the hold
to check for the bilge,
but after careful searching
I found no bilge water.
So I descended to the bottom
of the dhow, steered into the lagoon,
and when I reached the shore,
I blasted a cannon.
Its explosion blazed!
It reeked
a Meccan aroma
of the Arabian Lady.
When I inhaled her aroma,
I shuddered
as though from a cold
and went in search of healers.
The little dove's thighs
are like the butt of the royal clarion;
her girlfriends, eaten by envy,
curse her for it.
Her knees are special;
they are famous, celebrated
and well synchronized
as they turn around each other.
Her calves are moderate,
not too prominent,
but like a flute's mouthpiece
with a curved end.
The little rascal's foot soles
are covered by Indian slippers
of Arabian craftsmanship
ornamented with paintings.

It was good
The orchestral dance
Of our voices sipping dew
In the soft morning-rise
Of Africa south.
That was good.
We welcomed with a squeeze
The hand of desire as it dabbled and dappled
A summer mosaic
Across the canvas of thighs
Which swallowed the embrace
Of live dreams
It was good.
Now we swim in warm-baths
Of our nakedness,
Touching with our skin
The subterranean regions
Of our blood.
We move with the heave of time
Whose mouth is a fenceless water-fall
Stretching,
Turning some,
Now mellowing in one, with one.
It was good,
When tears watered the corpses
From the storage of past tales,
And tears circled their death
Above the face
Of the come of love
That was good.
Then we sponged
The ache of each beat
With the blend of hope
In sunbeam eyes
As I saw mine mirrored in yours

Headphones edged with brio,
bulging over skirted sofas.
Sport is the new sex.
Dogs versus coyotes on the tight 
end of the stereo.
Hazard lights stitch footsubishis and TV
chicken into seams of Nokia eleven hundred housing.
In loose sprays, cracked for patches 
of grey I save English names one cocktail 
at a time. Tusky Big Brother Africa house
mates sniff my lemon bracts. I'm middle
middle class with a chance of un|dress 
codes. Raglan sleeves, push up bras, harem
culottes, 
wine glass heels and a backpack full 
of silence. I will never wear myself out
trying to get rich.

How about it, then?
Shall I serve a late helping of morning;
slop poached pinks and yolky yellows
onto thick slices of dou
ghy landscape?
Shall I take the day off and a bus buried
by a loud pedal to a faded scrawl?
Invite your size six Adam's apple to my capacity
building workshop?
Shall I slaughter a mannequin?
Upload the video on YouTube?
Shall I read you some bumper sticker advice,
impress you with my flaky fonts and American't accent?
Save you fifty on a bootlegged DVD?

We used to fight flies and heat
In the bullet ridden grass thatched huts,
We lived in the hope of milk and honey.
We tried to share the little we got
with guerrilla forces
Who lived in hope too and tried
To survive with little or no food and water
Tyre sandals for shoes
and old clothes
looted or donated.
The signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement united us. 
Yes! We were united: together, Army and ordinary Citizens.
We decorated our bodies with ostrich feathers;
We danced and smiled, we laughed and celebrated
Together, we ate, 
together we drank,
Together we poured libations to bless the spirits
Of the fallen heroes buried or abandoned.
The Guerrilla Generals turned Politicians
Cruised the vehicles in our new dustbowl
They swim amidst ill
hooked wealth,
Cool Juba heat with the air conditioners
Chilling out of the newly furnished
Bungalows and palaces.
We fight flies and fan off
the airless heat in congested
Tin roofed shelters without ceiling boards
And
ventilated window.

Walking by the riverside,
Imagining dark eyes,
Tiny fish in Blue Ocean,
Crocodiles struggling to feed,
Hippos in the deep,
Waiting for the night to come.
Young Calypso suddenly appeared
In her flying dress,
Balancing a water jar and singing.
I tried to stop her just to say Hello,
The water jar dropped, water flooded the green grass
Forcefully uprooting and clearing weeds back to river.
Calypso's voice rang: Daddy! Daddy!
He has raped me.
I saw gigantic hands
Hold me by the throat.
A man in uniform
Manacled my hands.
Three years later
The man with gigantic
hands died; he left a letter,
Urging me to promise him
A grandchild

I died
But my heart still breathed 
I was speechless
But a voice resounded within
I was sightless 
But my inner eye watched the outside 
I was immobile 
But agile dreams took me miles away
I died 
But I died alive

Your teeth have fled their nest.
Dust rules over the Holy Book.
Untouched buttons of your radio look on.
Curtain folds are like a nurse's starched uniform.
Your soup bowl has become a roach's pool.
Your appetite is painted in dull colours.
Your walking stick is the centre in the spider's handcraft.
Vivacity basks in a second childhood.
The sturdy voice that bounced on walls is now drained.
The sharp eyesight 
simmers on dying fire.
Your countenance is the light of a fast sinking sun.
Muscles of steel now soft like newly ground corn.
Humour has abandoned your garden.
Where are the mighty hands that lifted me when I fell?
Silent weeds strangle years.
Tendrils of life are tangled up and bewildered.
Your worm eaten garb sways in the wind.
My eyes well up and rage weighs my throat down.
You are the mahogany never meant to shed his leaves.

home from the subway station
through my front door
over the years     wait for me to turn eighteen
with their eyes
with their cars
with their children in the backseat
in the empty parking lot     the echo of footsteps giving them hundreds of bodies
with their tongues out
with their teeth shining like flies
after i pay my fare and exit their taxi
into the bathroom
into the elevator
maybe even when i die and step away from my mottled body
i will look back to see them still
one hand hot against their groin
the other reaching for my hair

maybe the following draft will be better
greener
lush with hanging gardens
angerless lapis waters
in an expanse scrubbed clean of borders
our bodies roam unbeaten
unshot
unbruised by stranger's hands
sloe-eyed as children
we sleep unbroken in the night and do not dream and of course
we do not remember
of course
the blood circles
our new untethered bodies
unspilled

we believe in apocalypse because we are arrogant
because of our great luck
because we live a clean
unbroken line
because our small and personal world
has not yet ended 
we believe a world never has

skin like dusk on the collapsing horizon
can't you see it can't you help
can't you name it can't you loosen
the secret from my adolescent hands
when the sun goes down

men like locusts on the eastern horizon
can't you see it can't you
help
can't you stop them can't you unswing
my name from their dripping tongues
when the sun goes down
body an overripe fruit in the viscous summer
can't you see it can't it
stop
can't you untouch it can't you stow it back
into its perfect rind
wash it clean and send it home
before the sun goes down

i rent a room for two nights and nurse my bruised inner places     
nurse my small self
child-heart warped by leaving
warped by love spread thin
over phone lines    
seen only from above
from an airplane
my psychic tells me an act of love 
born of fear of being left
is not an act of love  
and i am made tender by hurting
tender city feet bruising on the ocean floor
my rented room on a street named either
for the hollow lung of a gun
or the glossy pages against which i measured my girlhood
studied the cursive shapes i could make my own wanting & wanted parts
and my wanting is an act of fear
the lover sleeps
and makes low purple sounds in his throat
and i think
i've made him up
the lover wakes to kiss my shoulder and
how do i know it is my shoulder
i watch the love happen
to me from somewhere above the room and long to take part
miss him until he leaves me or doesn't leave me or goes back
to his cluttered sleep
i sit for hours in cooling bathwater
and wait for something to root
to rot or blossom or die without sunlight

i tell a story sometimes that whitepeople love
it's about summer in khartoum
in the back of a pickup truck with my cousins
eating sunflower seeds with the shells
dangling from our dark lower lips
and we played our favorite game which
was to yell into the street the names
we knew best the names
we all had
mohammed ahmed omar
and see how many dozens
of  strangers
would answer

do you like it do you like
the way i mimic my mother's
accent when saying aloud a word
i cannot pronounce and have only
ever seen written down

or is it
my diasporic stink
my halved tongue
wandering forever at the borderlands
i never learned the word am i
a girl or am i an aperture
born by
the absence of a river
and broken
where the blue and white nile meet
the story is not new nor is it
monogamous i was not born i
was planted
at the place where
the world cracked in two and crawled
from the wound as a new kind of tree
swaying forever back and forth for your
translated pleasure
in the harmattan wind


My very pulse 
a poem  
a fuck you  
to the beneficiaries   
of  genocide who want  
nothing more than for me to jump  
off a roof          
to save themselves:   
the trouble  
of pushing me.

I have been waiting to write
you something
I have explained to self that
nudes exist
in place of  poems
that skin suffices
as border pillaging
more would be a cascade
more feels like the kind of betrayal
that leads to conquer
more to surrender:
I do not surrender
here.
do you surrender
in divulgence;
the parts kept
are the scraps that did not make it as marrow
the written parts kept
unrequited capitulation
but in every timeline it's you so
purge song!
purge purge purge

all modernist paintings lose value.
their coffee mug counterparts reign supreme
we say nothing and hide our things.
we say nothing but eat their tongues.
cannibals they screams when swallowed
digested as bloated colors
for the larynx. swelling in, swollen out

just for a self-help book or two is still an answer
do you really need to buy something every day
you finally say something but of course
everyone is gone
you begin to ask for lessons
from preschool teachers
from their students
curl into a ball and count to five million
they say
cry a little while remembering your favorite moment
your left side is wrinkled your eyes aging
in lieu of  sleep you imagine outcomes
it ends with a basket, a bench, car windows, dessert weather
you plan you will practice
there will be cued tears and small jokes and a completed letter
a desire entrapped by those
who lived long enough but could not write them down.
who else to ask you ask
who else to ask
weeks without touch
no grazing of the shoulders
no pushing no elementary embrace
she looks like you should
Or, weeks without letting anyone touch you
no hello kisses
no goodbye gestures
this is how I remember it
how do you remember it
you are devastated by the nothing that has happened
but this is absence
this is your dear

a poem cannot solve tonight
however much i worship her
she is never enough
a poem does not solve but i read another anyway
the title states it's about the apocalypse
from yesterday.
each couplet is his shoulders
an acquaintance of beauty towards his refrain
inner rhymes peering into steady oceans
his fears his wants his thoughts
not one cloaked metaphor (kindness)
his hair his lovers his jeans him  
the disaster rectified in the witnessing of his collarbones
his square
unbroken
jaw
finished.
i want to kill him. i close my eyes
to invent the scenarios
i plead
poem kill him.
all of  my dreams involve a murder
an eating of  the tongues
and yet the day's news of these exact events - 
one day i will understand that
the anathema is a poem i call my own
that could have been written by him
amen


there's a woman in hawaii, kills
octopi with her teeth
one so fixed on living
it wrapped her in a death
squeeze, pulled her bikini
top right off.
them octopi are just 
frat boys of the central pacific
& shouldn't that ease
her guilt
crushing their brains?
i laid a fleet week sailor
with a lei around her neck be-
cause she was black the lei
glowed in the dark be-
fore i could beat
my face (red lips for the long 
haul home) she asked are you
a whore, casually
as you might ask a person's
name, neither of  us did, i recall
her breasts, flawless, aureoles dark
as stout that sent and sent me
to the unisex restroom
wasn't a whore, i was
parched, watched the sky's
black calligraphy fade
to predawn washed
her hands, hands
she called property
of the u.s. government.
i know this story is messy
& the orchids are fake
at least let me flaunt
the veneers one dentist
offered if my lips covered
what medicaid wouldn't. well
don't the bible say
a woman's survival
depends upon her ability
to slay a man? don't it
say the best way to bleed
a thing
is with a slut's grip?

thank you nope no

bags, deemos, one 
brother like i give you

do i suppose they have cyphers 
on the other side, that cuzzo
is a krump king in the afterlife
giving dap to gods, has tut told him
pharaoh means house not king?
what if this burning turns me
into a house 
unable to sing since the most a house can do 
is groan?
the boy's hand on my skin
gauging its weather. he could freestyle 
to my heartbeat if it wasn't muffled
by body - suppose i'm becoming more body
less heart, body dilated 
as a pupil in the dark, to be already 
so dark, so bad a district 
of siamese brick 
ATM, EBT, is this 
what the dead miss - 
money? 
food stamps traded for wooden coins
at a farmer's market, coins
slipped onto the lids of the mortuary's poor? could i be
morphing into aken the boatman
or his boat meseket, aunt becoming myth 
of  safe passage of  nephews 
into the underworld?


on an ordinary night i read
a comments section full of  people
saying trans women deserve
to be murdered for existing
and then i brush my teeth and
go to bed like it's nothing.
i sit there and stare
at the ceiling until my eyes
adjust enough to see
the tiny cracks in it.
good shit, i think to myself.
great stuff. i have five hundred
names and all of them are bad.
together they sound like
baseball bats against bone
like wings beating frantically
in an airless space
like god asking herself
if she really exists.
it is surreal to imagine
how i will keep living like this
how i probably won't drink
myself  to death
how my skin will stretch
and fold in on itself
like time and space
and memory and dreams
how i would stay alive forever
and suffer the fate of the sun
and the heat death of  the universe
just to spite everyone.

11 am. time to wake up.
muscles sore, jaw clenched, warm light
scattering dreams of  violence across
the bedroom. i've chosen a self
too large for this body. too willing to
change for others. too beautiful
to appear in public. i'd tell you to walk
in my feet but they're all i have left.
i've been weathered down to the
ankles by all the news reports. all the
listening. all the not doing.
when i crawl out of bed i don't
know where to go. what to say.
i tried to talk about comfort
but how do you describe a color
you've never been allowed to see?

in the shadow
in the light
in this living body i feel a spectrum.
how many feelings can one girl have?
that was a rhetorical question, i already know.
everything goes on forever
long after we lose the ability
to process information.
when i appeared in the world for the first time
someone looked at my body
and said "boy"
and waved a pen like a magic wand.
twenty eight years later i am lucky to have survived
all the deep reds and shining yellows
that surround this circle of grey.
we know the calm before the storm
can sometimes be the storm.
we have named almost nothing
and everything we have named
has been wrong.


It isn't that dad doesn't love you or your brother
said Mum, greasing up our ashy legs with Vaseline
Or that your auntie Amy's a man stealing back-stabbing, cheating bitch
who can't keep a man so she has to steal somebody else's.
We just don't see eye to eye on much, that's all
and he wouldn't stop eating cashew nuts in bed
It's not that you mother and I hate each other
said Dad, pushing a crumpled ten pound note into my chinos pocket
- or that I forgot about your birthday
but I need time to think now. I'm moving in with Amy
and anyway, your mum cooks with too much salt.
It wasn't so much an affair, you understand
said Auntie Amy, lacing up my brothers small Nike trainers
and picking out my knots with the wooden comb shaped like a fist
but a meeting of minds outside of our respective vows
And bodies, muttered mum, when I told her later.
Two faced tramp. What a joke.
Don't tell anyone I said that.
Don't tell anyone I said that.
It's not as though your mums exactly an angel, either
said dad with blood red eyes
and a pulsing vein in his forehead
finishing the last of his whisky
and auntie Amy hissed, Easy Winston, you've had enough
and dad said, Don't tell me what to do
not even my wife yet, and you think you know it all.
It not that your family are going to hell, necessarily
said grandma, boiling up the green banana, yam and dumpling
and grating the coconut onto the rice and peas
They must just accept Jesus Christ into their lives
and put away the drink and sin and all the lies.
Now go and wash your hands and set the table.
Don't worry, child.
We'll pray for them tonight.


some lovers try to drag the night out of us. they go in armed with the sun, they go in ready to shoo that sadness out of our skin. you, my lover were light just as you were, you were light without even trying to be. you didn't scare my sadness away, you listened to it. you sat there and listened. and I am thankful because it seems I was carrying a world of hurt in my body and before you no one had ever paid it any mind. before you, no one was ever light enough or calm enough or ready enough to ask my sadness why it insisted on calling me home.

skin to skin
with a summer love
I was happy just to breathe 
him in.

you can be ready for love and still tremble, winch, want to flee. you can be ready for love
and still battle the urge to end it before it ever gets ruined.

sadness was never a friend of mine but she came around like I owed her something. she came around and wiped the drawers clean. oh she's a mean one that sadness! she's a mean one.

with that soft mouth,
rounded
shaped like a dream
you tell me
that I am the first
woman
you've ever pined for
and fall for you completely.

please,
give me love that fills and fills and never forsakes.

the truth is
I'll always have more honey for you.

I loved you dearly. A ripple in your world was a tsunami in mine.

I am soft
and I am not sorry.
I am soft
and I have no plans of
being otherwise.
I am soft now
I will be soft after.

can't I just be a black woman that loves herself in peace?
without having to explain
why my skin
( be it light honey or molasses)
is a dream?
why my hair
(coarse or sleek)
is a crown?
can't I just be a black woman that loves being a black woman
without having to be sorry
or humble
or polite about it?
Damn it!
who else has to justify loving themselves like this?
who else has to fight for the right to call themselves a blessing?
goodness,
can't I just be a black woman that loves herself in peace?

I am magic all over.


you are a horse running alone
and he tries to tame you
compares you to an impossible highway
to a burning house
says you are blinding him
that he could never leave you
forget you
want anything but you
you dizzy him, you are unbearable
every woman before or after you
is doused in your name
you fill his mouth
his teeth ache with memory of taste
his body just a long shadow seeking yours
but you are always too intense
frightening in the way you want him
unashamed and sacrificial
he tells you that no man can live up to the one who
lives in your head
and you tried to change didn't you?
closed your mouth more
tried to be softer
prettier
less volatile, less awake
but even when sleeping you could feel
him travelling away from you in his dreams
so what did you want to do, love
split his head open?
you can't make homes out of human beings
someone should have already told you that
and if he wants to leave
then let him leave
you are terrifying
and strange and beautiful
something not everyone knows how to love.

no one leaves home unless
home is the mouth of a shark
you only run for the border
when you see the whole city running as well
your neighbors running faster than you
breath bloody in their throats
the boy you went to school with
who kissed you dizzy behind the old tin factory
is holding a gun bigger than his body
you only leave home
when home won't let you stay.
no one leaves home unless home chases you
fire under feet
hot blood in your belly
it's not something you ever thought of doing
until the blade burnt threats into
your neck
and even then you carried the anthem under
your breath
only tearing up your passport in an airport toilets
sobbing as each mouthful of paper
made it clear that you wouldn't be going back.
you have to understand,
that no one puts their children in a boat
unless the water is safer than the land
no one burns their palms
under trains
beneath carriages
no one spends days and nights in the stomach of a truck
feeding on newspaper unless the miles travelled
means something more than journey.
no one crawls under fences
no one wants to be beaten
pitied
no one chooses refugee camps
or strip searches where your
body is left aching
or prison,
because prison is safer
than a city of fire
and one prison guard
in the night
is better than a truckload
of men who look like your father
no one could take it
no one could stomach it
no one skin would be tough enough
the
go home blacks
refugees
dirty immigrants
asylum seekers
sucking our country dry
niggers with their hands out
they smell strange
savage
messed up their country and now they want
to mess ours up
how do the words
the dirty looks
roll off your backs
maybe because the blow is softer
than a limb torn off
or the words are more tender
than fourteen men between
your legs
or the insults are easier
to swallow
than rubble
than bone
than your child body
in pieces.
i want to go home,
but home is the mouth of a shark
home is the barrel of the gun
and no one would leave home
unless home chased you to the shore
unless home told you
to quicken your legs
leave your clothes behind
crawl through the desert
wade through the oceans
drown
save
be hunger
beg
forget pride
your survival is more important
no one leaves home until home is a sweaty voice in your ear
saying-
leave,
run away from me now
i dont know what i've become
but i know that anywhere
is safer than here.

The nail technician pushes my cuticles
back, turns my hand over,
stretches the skin on my palm
and says I see your daughters
and their daughters.
That night, in a dream, the first girl emerges
from a slit in my stomach. The scar heals
into a smile. The man I love pulls the stitches out
with his fingernails. We leave black sutures
curling on the side of the bath.
I wake as the second girl crawls
head first up my throat
a flower, blossoming
out of the hole in my face. 

I have dreamt of you suspended
in amniotic fluid, your hair fanned
out and alive, long again, before the cancer.
Undying, our movements synchronised,
us, tied together at the navel,
umbilical cord and all its length tugging
at me, far as it might extend. Gregory Porter climbing
through there will be no love that's dying
here -  his voice, and how it soothes you from
beyond the distant wall of this maybe womb,
the faint rhythm of a bigger heart
above us.

I think I brought the war with me
on my skin, a shroud
circling my skull, matter under my nails.
It sits at my feet while I watch TV.
I hear its damp breath in the background
of every phone call. I feel it sleeping
between us in the bed. It lathers
my back in the shower. It presses
itself against me at the bathroom sink.
At night, it passes me the pills, it holds
my hand, I never meet its gaze. 

Mother says there are locked rooms inside all women; kitchen of lust,
bedroom of grief, bathroom of apathy.
Sometimes the men - they come with keys,
and sometimes, the men - they come with hammers.
Perhaps she has a plan, perhaps she takes him back to hers
only for him to wake up hours later in a bathtub full of ice,
with a dry mouth, looking down at his new, neat procedure.
I point to my body and say Oh this old thing? No, I just slipped it on.
Are you going to eat that? I say to my mother, pointing to my father who is lying on the dining room table, his mouth stuffed with a red apple.
Show us on the doll where you were touched, they said.
I said I don't look like a doll, I look like a house.
They said Show us on the house.
I should tell you about my first love who found a trapdoor under my left breast nine years ago, fell in and hasn't been seen since. Every
now and then I feel something crawling up my thigh. He should make himself known, I'd probably let him out. I hope he hasn't
bumped in to the others, the missing boys from small towns, with pleasant mothers, who did bad things and got lost in the maze of
my hair. I treat them well enough, a slice of bread, if they're lucky a piece of fruit. Except for Johnny with the blue eyes, who picked my locks and crawled in. Silly boy, chained to the basement of my fears, I play music to drown him out.
Knock knock.
Who's there?
No one.
At parties I point to my body and say This is where love comes to die. Welcome, come in, make yourself at home. Everyone laughs, they think I'm joking.

Knows loss intimately,
carries whole cities in her belly.
As a child, relatives wouldn't hold her.
She was splintered wood and sea water,
she reminded them of the war.
On her fifteenth birthday you taught her
how to tie her hair like rope
and smoke it over burning frankincense.
You made her gargle rosewater
and while she coughed, said
Macaanto, girls shouldn't smell
of lonely or empty.
You're her mother.
Why did you not warn her?
That she will not be loved
if she is covered in continents,
if her teeth are small colonies,
if her stomach is an island,
if her thighs are borders?
Who wants to lie down
and watch the world burn
in their bedroom?
Your daughter's face is a small riot,
her hands are a civil war,
a refugee camp behind each ear,
a body littered with ugly things
but God,
doesn't she wear
the world well.
