Dining tables are hot spots even when there’s no food on them. Playing games, helping with homework or just lingering after a meal, they’re where you share good times with family and friends. We make ours sturdy and durable, in lots of styles to help you find what suits your taste. Many are extendable so you’ll always have room for everyone.
Providing healthy food to hungry Chapel Hill and Carrboro children every week.
TABLE’s mission is to provide healthy, emergency food aid every week to hungry children living in Chapel Hill and Carrboro, NC.

One way to help is by making a tax deductible contribution to help us provide healthy food to more local hungry children. Make a single donation or set up an easy recurring donation. Anything you can do helps!
Your food donations enable our hunger relief programs to deliver healthy food to hungry children in Carrboro and Chapel Hill. Currently serving 600 children each week, your food contribution makes a difference.
TABLE depends on volunteers to prepare, pack and deliver bags to our kids every week as well as collect food, assist with PR, plan and work at special events, and much more.
For TABLE, spring brings a season of hope for our kids. Every seedling planted means more fresh food for every bag we fill and deliver. Every new child we feed is one more child who doesn’t go hungry on the weekends or during holidays and the summer. It is this season where TABLE plans for the future to ensure we reach more kids in Chapel Hill and Carrboro.
2018 marks TABLE’s 10th anniversary of feeding hungry children in Chapel Hill and Carrboro and we couldn’t be more excited! We have so much to be grateful for this year and to celebrate.
Have you ever thought about how your sense of sight, smell and touch impact the food choices you make? They are a vital component to our dietary decisions from what we choose to purchase at the grocery store or farmer’s market to what we order at a restaurant or cook at home.
Join neighbors and friends for delicious food and family fun - all to benefit TABLE's mission to feed local hungry kids.

late 12c., "board, slab, plate," from Old French table "board, plank, writing table, picture" (11c.), and late Old English tabele, from West Germanic *tabal (cf. Old High German zabel, German Tafel), both the French and Germanic words from Latin tabula "a board, plank, table," originally "small flat slab or piece" usually for inscriptions or for games, of uncertain origin, related to Umbrian tafle "on the board."

Figurative phrase turn the tables (1630s) is from backgammon (in Old and Middle English the game was called tables). Table talk is attested from 1560s, translating Latin colloquia mensalis. To table-hop is first recorded 1956. The adjectival phrase under-the-table "hidden from view" is recorded from 1949; under the table "passed out from excess drinking" is recorded from 1921.

Table is the first of three ventures in Asheville, NC, built by husband and wife team, Jacob and Alicia Sessoms. The two own and operate Table, The Imperial Life, an intimate cocktail lounge, and Tod’s Tasties, a neighborhood café in historic Montford, NC.
With Table, the Sessoms set out to create the space that they wanted to frequent - a real farm-to-table, creative, service driven, urban minded restaurant with an interesting wine list and cocktails. The resulting intimate dining room and small chef’s bar, offers a welcoming staff of service professionals that ensure that guests are comfortable and well-informed.
Since Table’s inception in 2005, many of Asheville's top chefs have passed through its doors and the inventive chef has earned an array of accolades, including being named a James Beard Award semifinalist for Best Chef Southeast in 2010. Such a history has earned Chef Jacob Sessoms the nickname of, “the grandfather of creative cooking” in Asheville.
More than a decade into its life, Table remains one of the longest standing fine-dining ventures in Asheville, continuing to set trends, while fostering supportive relationships within the local food community.

Kitchen & Dining Tables
When it comes to getting a custom-made table, there aren't many that feel better to use than a solid wood dining table. Wood has a natural feel and when you have a high value table you can feel the quality even when you put your hands on the table. Wood dining tables come in all shapes and sizes so it's important to know what to look for when you get a table. Some factors you should keep an eye out for when you're getting a new table are table shapes and sizes.
Wood Dining Table Shape
A solid wood dining table can come in any conceivable shape, however the most common shape that you can find these tables is a square or rectangular shape. These are simple shapes that makes it easy to set up the dinner table and if you need to add extra seats it’s a simple task since you just need to add chairs at the end or sides of the table. Round dining tables are also exceptionally popular tables to have in your kitchen. These tables are fantastic because you can put them anywhere, since their round shape means there is no correct orientation. So there's one less thing to worry about when your setting up your dining room layout, which makes this table shape a great option if you want something that’s simple to add to your kitchen.
Wood Dining Table Sizes
Once you've decided on a shape, you should think about the size of your table. Dining tables can come in any size ranging from small to large which gives you a lot of options when it comes to finding a table that can accommodate everyone. If you need a table for a small apartment then a small counter height table is a great option. On the other hand if you have friends over frequently or have a big family then a large solid wood dining table is a good choice as well.

Two guys who like to eat meat thought that cooking vegeTABLEs was more exciting. We know we aren't the first to do this, but we hope you try us out anyways (and, the restaurant name sounds like 'label', in case you were wondering).
Is made with lots of love and care. We cut and brine our fresh pickles, grind and hand form all our burger patties, and hand cut all our potatoes. Our staff works hard to ensure that your food tastes great, and gets you out our doors and back to your life as quickly as possible!
We make our staff a priority in a number ways. Some of these are by paying them above the full Seattle minimum wage and by subsidizing their public transportation needs. Our prices reflect this, and while we are very thankful that you would like to leave an additional gratuity we would encourage you use it instead for your next visit to ‘TABLE!

I’m DMing for a group of eight people. This leads to some rather interesting situations, as they are all slowly warming to their characters and thus making their backstories more complex and detailed.
A couple weeks ago, our Half-Elf Ranger sent me a text asking if he could have been cursed (ostensibly by our BBEG). I'm running a homebrew, so if someone wants to do something interesting I will do my best to make it work. So after some talking back and forth, we decided that he would turn into a Balghura (a demon that strongly resembles a 10 foot tall ape) whenever someone he cared deeply for was threatened. That person happened to be…
