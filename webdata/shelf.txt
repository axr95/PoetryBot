Old Norse skjölf "bench"), from PIE root *(s)kel- (1) "to cut, cleave" (see scale (n.1)). Shelf life first recorded 1927.

Shelves and bookcases can change a room. More than just storage, wall shelves give you a decorative element you can build your space around. Storage shelves and pantry shelving add function to underutilized areas, while a corner bookshelf or full corner bookcase can create an instant reading nook. There are many types of shelving, from designer-inspired floating wall shelves to durable metal garage shelves. Make a statement with a tall ladder bookshelf in your library, or enhance a spare bedroom with a small bookshelf. Wall-mounted shelves are space-saving and secure. Play up minimal décor with white shelves, metal shelves or streamlined glass shelves. A white bookcase or white bookshelf has a lighter feel than more traditional stained wood styles. No matter what type of wall bookshelves you choose, you’ll find lots of options at Lowe’s.
