A wall is a structure that defines an area, carries a load, or provides shelter or security. There are many kinds of walls:


Wall comes from Latin vallum meaning "...an earthen wall or rampart set with palisades, a row or line of stakes, a wall, a rampart, fortification..." while the Latin word murus means a defensive stone wall.[1] English uses the same word to mean an external wall and the internal sides of a room, but this is not universal. Many languages distinguish between the two. In German, some of this distinction can be seen between Wand and Mauer, in Spanish between pared and muro.
The word wall originally referred to defensive walls and ramparts.
The purposes of the walls in buildings are to support roofs, floors and ceilings; to enclose a space as part of the building envelope along with a roof to give buildings form; and to provide shelter and security. In addition, the wall may house various types of utilities such as electrical wiring or plumbing. Wall construction falls into two basic categories: framed walls or mass-walls. In framed walls the load is transferred to the foundation through posts, columns or studs. Framed walls most often have three or more separate components: the structural elements (such as 2×4 studs in a house wall), insulation, and finish elements or surfaces (such as drywall or panelling). Mass-walls are of a solid material including masonry, concrete including slipform stonemasonry, log building, cordwood construction, adobe, rammed earth, cob, earthbag construction, bottles, tin cans, straw-bale construction, and ice.
There are three basic methods walls control water intrusion: moisture storage, drained cladding, or face-sealed cladding.[2] Moisture storage is typical of stone and brick mass-wall buildings where moisture is absorbed and released by the walls of the structure itself. Drained cladding also known as screened walls[3] acknowledges moisture will penetrate the cladding so a moisture barrier such as housewrap or felt paper inside the cladding provides a second line of defense and sometimes a drainage plane or air gap allows a path for the moisture to drain down through and exit the wall. Sometimes ventilation is provided in addition to the drainage plane such as in rainscreen construction. Face-sealed also called barrier wall or perfect barrier[3] cladding relies on maintaining a leak-free surface of the cladding. Examples of face sealed cladding are the early exterior insulation finishing systems, structural glazing, metal clad panels, and corrugated metal.
Building walls frequently become works of art, externally and internally, such as when featuring mosaic work or when murals are painted on them; or as design foci when they exhibit textures or painted finishes for effect.
In architecture and civil engineering, curtain wall refers to a building facade that is not load-bearing but provides decoration, finish, front, face, or historical preservation.
Precast walls are walls which have been preassembled in a factory, and then shipped to where it is needed, ready to install. It is faster to install compared to brick and other walls, and may have a lower cost compared to other types of wall. [5]
Mullion walls are a structural system that carries the load of the floor slab on prefabricated panels around the perimeter.
A tall, deep-base exterior security wall which deters intrusion by climbing and tunneling. Also known as a Murno Gladst Fence[6]
A partition wall is a usually thin wall that is used to separate or divide a room, primarily a pre-existing one. Partition walls are usually not load-bearing, and can be constructed out of many materials, including steel panels, bricks, cloth, plastic, plasterboard, wood, blocks of clay, terra-cotta, concrete, and glass.
Some partition walls are made of sheet glass. Glass partition walls are a series of individual toughened glass panels mounted in wood or metal framing. They may be suspended from or slide along a robust aluminium ceiling track.[7] The system does not require the use of a floor guide, which allows easy operation and an uninterrupted threshold.
A timber partition consists of a wooden framework, supported on the floor or by side walls. Metal lath and plaster, properly laid, forms a reinforced partition wall. Partition walls constructed from fibre cement backer board are popular as bases for tiling in kitchens or in wet areas like bathrooms. Galvanized sheet fixed to wooden or steel members are mostly adopted in works of temporary character. Plain or reinforced partition walls may also be constructed from concrete, including pre-cast concrete blocks. Metal framed partitioning is also available. This partition consists of track (used primarily at the base and head of the partition) and studs (vertical sections fixed into the track typically spaced at 24", 16", or at 12").
Internal wall partitions, also known as office partitioning, are usually made of plasterboard (drywall) or varieties of glass. Toughened glass is a common option, as low-iron glass (better known as opti-white glass) increases light and solar heat transmission.
Wall partitions are constructed using beads and tracking that is either hung from the ceiling or fixed into the ground.[8] The panels are inserted into the tracking and fixed. Some wall partition variations specify their fire resistance and acoustic performance rating.
Movable partitions are walls that open to join two or more rooms into one large floor area. These include:
Party walls are walls that separate buildings or units within a building. They provide fire resistance and sound resistance between occupants in a building. The minimum fire resistance and sound resistance required for the party wall is determined by a building code and may be modified to suit a variety of situations. Ownership of such walls can become a legal issue. It is not a load-bearing wall and may be owned by different people.
An infill wall is the supported wall that closes the perimeter of a building constructed with a three-dimensional framework structure.
Fire walls resist spread of fire within or sometimes between structures to provide passive fire protection. A delay in the spread of fire gives occupants more time to escape and fire fighters more time to extinguish the fire. Such walls have no windows, and are made of non-combustible material such as concrete, cement block, brick, or fire rated drywall—and have wall penetrations sealed with special materials. A doorway in a firewall must have a rated fire door. Fire walls provide varying resistance to the spread of fire, some intended to last one to four hours. Firewalls, generally, can also act as smoke barriers when constructed vertically from slab to roof deck and horizontally from an exterior wall to exterior wall subdividing a building into sections. When constructed in this manner the fire wall can also be referred to as an Area Separation Wall.
Shear walls resist lateral forces such as in an earthquake or severe wind. There are different kinds of shear walls such as the steel plate shear wall.
Knee walls are short walls that either support rafters or add height in the top floor rooms of houses. In a 1 1⁄2-story house, the knee wall supports the half story.
Cavity walls are walls made with a space between two "skins" to inhibit heat transfer.
Pony wall (or dwarf wall) is a general term for short walls, such as:
A trombe wall in passive solar building design acts as a heat sink.
On a ship, a wall that separates major compartments is called a bulkhead. A thinner wall between cabins is called a partition.
Boundary walls include privacy walls, boundary-marking walls on property, and town walls. These intergrade into fences. The conventional differentiation is that a fence is of minimal thickness and often open in nature, while a wall is usually more than a nominal thickness and is completely closed, or opaque. More to the point, an exterior structure of wood or wire is generally called a fence—but one of masonry is a wall. A common term for both is barrier, which is convenient for structures that are partly wall and partly fence—for example the Berlin Wall. Another kind of wall-fence ambiguity is the ha-ha—which is set below ground level to protect a view, yet acts as a barrier (to cattle, for example).
Before the invention of artillery, many of the world's cities and towns, particularly in Europe and Asia, had defensive or protective walls (also called town walls or city walls). In fact, the English word "wall" derives from Latin vallum—a type of fortification wall. These walls are no longer relevant for defense, so such cities have grown beyond their walls, and many fortification walls, or portions of them, have been torn down—for example in Rome, Italy and Beijing, China. Examples of protective walls on a much larger scale include the Great Wall of China and Hadrian's Wall.
Some walls formally mark the border between one population and another. A border wall is constructed to limit the movement of people across a certain line or border. These structures vary in placement with regard to international borders and topography. The most famous example of border barrier in history is probably the Great Wall of China, a series of walls that separated the Empire of China from nomadic powers to the north. The most prominent recent example is the Berlin Wall, which surrounded the enclave of West Berlin and separated it from East Germany for most of the Cold War era.
In areas of rocky soils around the world, farmers have often pulled large quantities of stone out of their fields to make farming easier and have stacked those stones to make walls that either mark the field boundary, or the property boundary, or both.
Retaining walls resist movement of earth, stone, or water. They may be part of a building or external. The ground surface or water on one side of a retaining wall is typically higher than on the other side. A dike is a retaining wall, as is a levee, a load-bearing foundation wall, and a sea wall.
Special laws often govern walls that neighbouring properties share. Typically, one neighbour cannot alter the common wall if it is likely to affect the building or property on the other side. A wall may also separate apartment or hotel rooms from each other. Each wall has two sides and breaking a wall on one side will break the wall on the other side.
Portable walls, such as room dividers or portable partitions divide a larger open space into smaller rooms. Portable walls can be static, such as cubicle walls, or can be wall panels mounted on casters to provide an easy way to reconfigure assembly space. They are often found inside schools, churches, convention centers, hotels, and corporate facilities.
A temporary wall is constructed for easy removal or demolition. A typical temporary wall can be constructed with 1⁄2" (6 mm) to 5⁄8" (16 mm) sheet rock (plasterboard), metal 2 × 3s (approx. 5 × 7 cm), or 2 × 4s, or taped, plastered and compounded. Most installation companies use lattice (strips of wood) to cover the joints of the temporary wall with the ceiling. These are sometime known as pressurized walls or temporary pressurized walls.
Walls are often seen in popular culture, representing barriers preventing progress or entry. For example, the progressive/psychedelic rock band Pink Floyd used a metaphorical wall to represent the isolation felt by the protagonist of their 1979 concept album The Wall. American poet laureate Robert Frost describes a pointless rock wall as a metaphor for the myopia of the culture-bound in his poem "Mending Wall", published in 1914. In a real-life example, the Berlin Wall, constructed by the Soviet Union to divide Berlin into NATO and Warsaw Pact zones of occupation, became a worldwide symbol of oppression and isolation.
In some cases, a wall may refer to an individual's debilitating mental or physical condition, seen as an impassable barrier.
Another common usage is as a communal surface to write upon. For instance the social networking site Facebook previously used an electronic "wall" to log the scrawls of friends until it was replaced by the "timeline" feature.

Q: Has President Donald Trump started building the wall between United States and Mexico?
A: Congress approved $1.6 billion to replace existing barriers and add some fencing in new areas. The new barriers are not concrete and not like any of Trump’s wall prototypes.
Has Trump started building the wall between USA & Mexico?
Since the omnibus spending bill for fiscal year 2018 passed in late March, President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed his long-promised wall is now under construction.
“We’ve already started building it,” Trump said in West Virginia on April 5. “We have a billion-six. We’ve started building it and fixing miles and miles of wall that’s already up — and fence. And we’re going to have our wall.”
“We’ve started building the wall,” he proclaimed in remarks with Baltic leaders on April 3.
“We started building our wall,” he said in Ohio on March 30. “I’m so proud of it. We started. We started. We have $1.6 billion, and we’ve already started. … We have $1.6 billion toward the wall, and we’ve done the planning.”
By contrast, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, founder of the House Freedom Caucus, said of the omnibus bill, “The one thing we don’t fund is the one issue we all campaigned on — a border security wall — and that is not in the legislation.”
And here’s House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi’s version of what the bill does: “Democrats won explicit language restricting border construction to the same see-through fencing that was already authorized under current law.”
Those seemingly conflicting statements may lead to some confusion. One of our readers asked, “Has Trump started building the wall between USA & Mexico?”
The short answer is that the omnibus bill funds some new fencing, though far less than Trump had hoped it would. The new barriers are also not the kind of solid, concrete wall Trump once described during the campaign. Nor is it anything like any of the prototypes Trump visited in mid-March.
Trump and others in his administration are calling what is going up “the wall.” The omnibus describes it as “fencing.” Some may say that’s a matter of semantics, and indeed many officials and journalists use the terms interchangeably. But Trump has often insisted there is a difference between a fence and wall, and that he’d be building a wall.
Finally, Trump officials say the omnibus will fund about 100 miles of “new” wall, but most of that is replacing existing border fencing deemed inadequate or dilapidated.
Let’s take a deeper look at what the bill does and does not fund for barriers along the border with Mexico. And then let’s dig deeper into what Trump promised.
On March 23, Trump signed the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill (also known as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018), though he said there “are a lot of things that I’m unhappy about in this bill.”
Although Trump had asked for $25 billion for wall construction, the bipartisan spending bill provides what Trump called only an “initial down payment” of $1.6 billion in funding. But even that sum comes with significant strings attached.
Here’s what that $1.6 billion is for (see Section 230, starting on page 673):
The bill further states that the money can only be used to build “operationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, [May 5, 2017] such as currently deployed steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety.”
Readers may recall Trump on March 13 toured eight wall prototypes — which you can see here — that he had put out to bid early in his presidency. The language in the omnibus bill precludes funding for any of those designs.
In a March 30 briefing, Customs and Border Protection Acting Deputy Commissioner Ronald D. Vitiello said the spending bill will fund about 100 miles of “border wall system,” though he added that “does not fully fund our needs in the most critical locations.”
According to Vitiello, the construction near San Diego will include 14 miles of “new border wall,” replacing “old, dilapidated [Vietnam War-era helicopter] landing mats in favor of a steel bollard wall” and replacing 14 miles of secondary barriers.
In Calexico, California, the federal government will replace two miles of pedestrian barrier with “a new 30-foot border wall,” he said. In Santa Teresa, New Mexico, the government will build 20 miles of border wall, he said. According to the Washington Examiner, the new barriers in Santa Teresa will replace “three-foot-tall posts and a taller mesh fence.”
Vitiello said the government will build four miles of new border wall in El Paso, Texas, and 35 new gates along a 55-mile stretch of existing border wall in the Rio Grande Valley.
Finally, Vitiello said, the Department of Homeland Security will replace 47 miles of “dilapidated border fencing with new border wall system in various locations along the southwest border.” Also in the Rio Grande Valley, he said, it plans to build 25 miles of new levee wall in Hidalgo County, and eight miles of “new border wall system” in Starr County, Texas. All of that is made possible by funding in the 2018 spending bill, he said.
By our count, that comes to less than 40 miles of new barrier where there wasn’t any before.
Although most of the new barrier will replace old or ineffective fencing, Vitiello said, “I would say that it’s all new because there’s a different design going in. It’s replacing stuff that is unsuitable, the dilapidated wall, this old landing mat fence. It doesn’t serve our needs anymore.”
The president would ultimately like to have 1,000 miles of barrier, Vitiello said, and there is currently 654 miles of fencing. So the funding bill leaves the president well short of his goal.
On March 28, Trump tweeted photos from a briefing “on the start of our Southern Border WALL!”

The pictures show steel bollards, which look like a comb, and provide a barrier that border patrol agents can see through — a feature that Trump has repeatedly said over the last nine months is critical for enforcement purposes.
That raises the question, though: Is the barrier funded through the omnibus a wall or a fence? At one time, that distinction was important to Trump.
According to Vocabulary.com, “The difference between a fence and a wall is that you can almost always see through a fence, at least to some degree, while a wall is solid.”
If that’s the case, then what is going up is fence. But, to be fair, many politicians, media figures and even border experts often use the terms wall and fence interchangeably.
And so has Trump — at times.
Prior to announcing his presidential candidacy, for example, Trump said in an interview with CBN News in May 2015, “I would build a wall like nobody can build a wall.” But later he added, “Nobody can build a fence like me … I build great buildings all over the world.”
By the time Trump announced his candidacy for president on June 16, 2015, he had settled on the nomenclature: wall.
Trump, June 16: I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I’ll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.
Two days later, in an interview on Fox News, Sean Hannity said, “You said you — you would build a fence — nobody could build a better fence than Donald Trump.”
Trump corrected him. “A wall,” Trump said.
In August of that year, Trump again stressed that he was proposing a wall, not a fence, as he made very clear in a tweet attacking Republican primary opponent Jeb Bush, who criticized Trump’s plan for a border “fence.” “It’s not a fence, Jeb,” he wrote. “It’s a WALL, and there’s a BIG difference!”
Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a "fence." It's not a fence, Jeb, it's a WALL, and there's a BIG difference!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2015

So Trump saw a difference between fences and walls. But he did not explain exactly what those differences were.
We could find only one instance where he described the details of the wall as a solid structure, as he described laying down “precast planks.” It came during a campaign speech in August 2015 in New Hampshire. It’s height? Trump pointed to the ceiling of the auditorium and said, “Higher.”
Trump, Aug. 19, 2015: I will build the greatest wall that you’ve ever seen. … I already know what it should look like. … Did you ever see precast plank for parking garages? OK, as an example. … So you take precast plank. It comes 30 feet long, 40 feet long, 50 feet long. You see the highways where they can span 50, 60 feet, even longer than that, right? And you do a beautiful, nice precast plank with beautiful everything. … You put that plank up and you dig your footings. And you put that plank up — there’s no ladder going over that. If they ever go up there, they’re in trouble, because here’s no way to get down. Maybe a rope.
In a “60 Minutes” interview shortly after his election, Trump continued to distinguish between walls and fences, and allowed that fences might be appropriate in places.
Lesley Stahl, Nov. 13, 2016: So let’s go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if you’re going to do what you said or you’re going to change it in any way. Are you really going to build a wall?
Trump: Yes.
Stahl: They’re talking about a fence in the Republican Congress, would you accept a fence?
Trump: For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I’m very good at this, it’s called construction.
Stahl: So part wall, part fence?
Trump: Yeah, it could be – it could be some fencing.
On March 17, 2017, Customs and Border Protection issued two requests for proposals “to acquire multiple conceptual wall designs with the intent to construct multiple prototypes.” One RFP was for a “solid concrete border wall,” and the second RFP was for “other border wall.” For the “other border wall,” the RPF says: “Prototypes constructed in response to this solicitation must offer designs that are alternatives to reinforced solid concrete walls (i.e. no solid concrete external faces).”
That summer, Trump began talking about the need to be able to see through the wall.
Speaking with reporters on Air Force One on July 14, 2017, Trump said, “One of the things with the wall is you need transparency. … You have to be able to see through it. In other words, if you can’t see through that wall — so it could be a steel wall with openings, but you have to have openings because you have to see what’s on the other side of the wall.”
In an interview on Fox News in November, Trump said the wall would be drawn from one of the prototypes, and he again stressed the need to be able to see through the wall. “You know, you think we’re going to build a nice, simple concrete wall, but it’s not that simple.”
The eight companies were ultimately chosen to build prototypes 18 to 30 feet tall. Half were made primarily of reinforced concrete; the other four were made out of “other materials.” After viewing them in March, Trump said, “some work very well; some don’t work so well. When we build, we want to build the right thing.”
Again, the funding in the omnibus appropriations bill precludes construction of the prototype designs. The bill funds about 100 miles of border barrier in various places, according to Customs and Border Protection. That’s far less than what Trump said he intends to ultimately build. And much of that is replacement for existing fencing that is dilapidated or inadequate. The spending bill funds nearly $1.6 billion worth of what it refers to as “fencing.” Trump now calls that “wall.” But he didn’t always think those were the same thing.

Battles are infamously difficult to film. Actors have to learn and repeatedly execute insanely complex choreography; hundreds of extras have to be managed; and horses don’t care about your schedule. So, battles take a long time: the greatest ones yet, the Battle of the Bastards and the Loot Train ambush, each swallowed about a month of precious production time. If you understand that’s a lot, you’ll be properly impressed when you learn that the battle shoot we have been following since late January has now wrapped after 55 consecutive nights! Beware: known spoilers are discussed below!

The largest battle sequence ever in Game of Thrones has finally come to a close, after months of night shoots at the Moneyglass set in Toome and the Magheramorne green screen set. The multi-purpose Magheramorne set may yet be used for other scenes, but this latest battle of Winterfell is over—though we won’t get to see for another year.
As we’ve seen in previous years, when such an ardous shoot is over the producers celebrate the occasion in some way, and we know this time was no different, as much of the crew went on social media to share a thank you note by “the producer types.” Jonathan Quinlan, assistant director in 20 episodes, was one of these crew members:

The funny, heartfelt note cites “the cold, the snow, the rain, the mud, the sheep shit of Toome”, in reference to the Winterfell set in Moneyglass, Toome; as well as “the winds of Magheramorne.” In the caption below the photo, Quinlan helpfully added: “Says it all. 55 consecutive nights. 11 weeks. 3 locations. You’ll never again see anything like it.”
These two and a half months of shooting more than double the previous record for a Game of Thrones battle shoot—which likely already was a TV record, as well. Unless the upcoming King’s Landing shoot dethrones it, which seems unlikely, this battle of Winterfell will be the biggest, most expensive action scene we’ve ever seen on TV. Of course, shooting time doesn’t necessarily translate to screen time, so this may or may not be the longest battle in the show, but it will certainly be the most elaborate.
As for the “3 locations” Quinlan makes reference to, aside from the obvious Moneyglass and Magheramorne (specified by the producers’ note and reported on by us for months), the mystery location could be Saintfield, in which we know they filmed but little else.
So that’s it! No more furtive photos in the dark for us to obsess over. Coming up next: the Dragonpit, the King’s Landing battle, and who knows what else! Stay tuned.

I am completely in awe of all of the people who have made Game of Thrones. It is and always will be one of my most favorite shows. It will be epic and bittersweet for this last season. I am going to miss it when it’s over. Everyone is so talented that has worked on it. Gratitde to all who have worked so hard to entertain us over these years.

Port,
I understand the confusion: they are old spoilers, but spoilers nonetheless. Some people are extremely sensitive to spoilers, and I’m learning to accomodate to them. The mere mention of battles taking place in Winterfell and King’s Landing is a spoiler for some people, and we have to respect that.
To avoid any confusion, I changed “spoilers below the cut” to “known spoilers are discussed below.” Hopefully that clears things up.

Well, if all of this filming has been dedicated to one battle sequence or perhaps a sequence of battles, then it may suggest (much to some people’s chagrin, I’m sure) that the Night King will be defeated in The North.
If they’re never going to repeat this sort of shoot again and, given that the King’s Landing battles/scenes don’t yet appear to be set in the midst of a deep winter, does that point towards the King’s Landing conquest/destruction being pre or post War for the Dawn?

Wow, that’s impressive shooting time.
Will it be screentime long? Maybe it’s so elaborate, so complex, with added cgi elements, that shooting it took 55 days, but it’ll end up only 15-25 minutes screentime?
I personally am not big on battles. Yes, they happen, but most of big battles in S1, S2 and S3 took place off screen and it didn’t bother me. I loved Blackwater (S2E9) and the battle for the Wall in S4 (especially that 360 degree single shot!), and Hardhome, BoB and Loot train have been impressive… but… Well, big battle scenes aren’t why I watch this show. I don’t mind them, just as long as there’s time for character moments.
Still, a huge hat tip to everybody involved in the gruelling work to produce the S8 battles for us. We’ll love them.

I’m not sure about those photos and those so called spoilers he leaked were already posted by several people writing fan-fiction, unless they guessed right but I don’t buy it. Essentially someone got on set while the crew was on March break and filmed a bunch of prosthetics arranged in piles. We know there is going to be fighting and we know people will die – it’s GOT and it’s the final season so I don’t think there is much in the way of ‘spoilers’ there. I also doubt he was involved in Production – he’d have broken his NDA and his job would be lost and his reputation toast. I think that site is being trolled big time. I trust this site more than I would Freefolk as this point for GOT news.

HouseMartellBitches: Freefolk has pictures from the battle, with corpses and house sigils (very interesting, some would say, spoilery mix).They are great pics, reveal a lot, and are clearly from a guy involved in production, who had actual MAJOR spoilers relating to the battle, that clearly come from being firsthand on filming.
Curious as to why there was no post for them, they’re pretty spread around (I didn’t even originally come across them on Freefolk).
I’m a little bit surprised there was no post too actually. I’m sure there’s a good reason for it. But I (very rarely) visit WiC 2.0, if you will, and I found them there. Ever since WotW was founded, I migrated over like 99.9% of the way. I think this was the first time I spent that 0.01% on WiC and stumbled upon something the good folk here hadn’t already reported!

I just hope the battle scene isn’t so frenetic that it becomes a blur. I prefer when there are action breaks to focus on a character’s mindset in the moment.
LadyGoodmanQuote Reply
We knew that the second Long Night was coming, and there’s a good reason why these big action sequences need to be shot after dark. But it still makes me a little nervous that the end product will prove inadequately lit for the viewer with anything less than a gigantic TV screen with easily accessible brightness control. There have been a fair few nighttime scenes – and even just indoor scenes in somber places – in previous seasons that were way too murky for my screen.

Given how long it is, I’m almost certain there will be plenty of personal interactions. I know certain people here such as Firannion are really worried the little moments will be lost in the chaos but we’ve never had a massive battle with this many important nonfighters together.
I’m pretty sure we are in for something truly special, something which will dwarf every single large scene in the show.

Precisely. As much as I appreciate big battle scenes on a technical level, I don’t think there are any that I’ve rewatched more than once.
For S8, I’d trade a half hour big-budget battle for a well-written 30-minute, quiet scene of Sansa and Arya reuniting with the repentant Sandor and quaffing ale together. The big fella deserves one happy memory before his big showdown….

I would say…it’s hard to tell at this point. “The Watchers on the Wall” (S4e9) was a fabulous non-stop battle that wasn’t “climactic” – in the sense that the defenders merely held off the invaders and lived to fight another day. It was still glorious – except for the romantic casualty. 🏹😢

Allow me to get a bit emotional for a second (those who are too jaded to tolerate a bit of sentimentality, look away):
I, too, love the small character moments, but the grandeur and quality of the battle scenes always remind me of how lucky I am as a viewer. The people involved in this show are fucking incredible. I, for one, couldn’t be happier with the quality of the adaptation of a series of books I loved. There have been a couple of missteps, but they’re minor quibbles when compared to the overall product. The casting is uniformly perfect, and the dedication of all involved, from said cast and the extras, to the writers, stunt team, crew, producers – fuck, c’mon. We have to give them the credit they deserve.
Also, it should be recognised that the battle sequences in Game of Thrones aren’t mindless action scenes. They’re impactful because they do take the time to slow down and focus on the character moments. Here are but a few: Grenn reciting NW oath as he faced his death; Jon holding Ygritte in his arms while the fighting went on around him; Jaime’s heroic charge toward Drogon.
There’s no better example than the Battle of the Bastards. It was a unique moment in television mostly because of the acutely painful realism of the fighting itself, and because of the emotional beats hit with respect to Jon – none of which relied on CGI. Jon’s desperate race out to save Rickon? No CGI. Jon standing to face the cavalry? No CGI (and I’m tearing up just thinking about it even now). The crush, where Jon almost died, and fought his way out through the bodies? No GCI.
All of those moments had way more impact than the arrival of the Vale, which was all GCI, and had been telegraphed (and for me, it wasn’t triumphant as perhaps the writers hoped, but tainted with wrongness because of the deceptive way it came about). So I have confidence that this battle will be no different. And it’s for Winterfell. It could be anything other than emotional. I’m anticipating it with excitement and fear both.

I hope the showrunners will issue some behind-the-scenes material, so we could understand this truly heroic shooting better and preferably, before the show airs. I remember how we speculated about the BOB behind the scenes materials and wouldn’t mind repeating that, though after the show will do for me as well.

Very much agreed. I was accidentally spoiled all over the place last year, and it greatly diminished my enjoyment of the season (in part because of the bitching associated with some of the information). WotW is a relatively safe place because spoilers are well labelled, and because it doesn’t tolerate uncensored spoiler chat in the comments.
As an aside, I hope there aren’t any major script leaks this year. It was a massive insult to everyone involved in the show, and I hope that guy was found and fired. But not before getting a punch to the nuts courtesy of the Mountain.

Didn’t read all the comments so I don’t know if anyone addressed this yet, but I’m kind of disheartened over the “they won’t care how tired you were or how tough it was to do your job…” part. I know myself and many others thoroughly enjoy the amount of work that goes into our favourite, and award-winning, scenes. My favourite featurettes are usually about the stunt coordinators and the amount of work that goes into scenes like BoB, the Loot Train attack, Battle at Blackwater Bay, and the battle at Castle Black. Anyways, can’t wait to watch what the crew has been working so hard on!
Dark SisterQuote Reply
What I think will happen: I think this will be episode 3, why it will be the biggest battle is I think the way it will be told. What I think will happen is the following in episode 3: – We open the episode with some character moments, tension will run high emotionally (maybe an argument with Dany or Sansa). – Then somebody will attack winterfell, this will be done by some humans: Unsatisfied Northerners because of Dany (would be amazing if this is the case and we have couple of minutes before a big argument that for instance Sansa explain to Jon working with Dany will lead to northerners deserting him) or maybe Cercei will attack them. – Jaime will save the day at winterfel defeating the attackers and swears fealty to the starks and Dany. We get the feeling this is going to be all okay. Then there will be 3 blasted. – The Night King is at their door. Big sequence with them. – And maybe even something after that scene (like beyond the wall)

Che,
Interpersonal, “high thread count”™ emotional moments incorporated within pulse-pounding action scenes are when GoT is at its best.
Exhibit A: The last segment of “The Door.” I felt like my heart was inside a Cuisinart riding on a rollercoaster. That back and forth between idyllic past WF and future 3ER cave, with Meera’s pleading voice echoing from the future, followed by the desperate chase through the cave tunnel, and the final alternating young Hodor/future Hodor…. That was some incredible work by director Jack Bender, the special effects dept., the actors, and countless other crew members. I’m sure it took days or weeks to put together that ~ 15 minutes of on-screen craziness. To top it off, was the reveal that the lovable simpleton sidekick character was really a tragic, heroic figure. I usually loathe “unhappy” endings because most of the time they involve cheap deaths or deaths for shock value. This was one of the rare exceptions: going out as a hero, or for the sake of the greater good.
I’ll stop. Sorry. I got carried away.

Am not jaded enough and definitely agree with everything in your post! The battle sequences are incredible TV in and of themselves, but what has me re-watching them time and time again is the human aspect.
Blackwater back in season two was the first big battle sequence in GoT – and when I think of that, I think of Davos’s grief at the loss of his son, the Hound’s fear of fire, and Pod’s loyalty towards Tyrion. I think of Tyrion’s determination to fight regardless of his physical prowess. I think of his speech to rally the men; a speech a king should’ve given.
You make soooooo many good points on Watchers on the Wall and Battle of the Bastards. In my opinion, one of the reasons the latter made such good TV was the decision to follow Jon and show the battle through the perspective of one key character. It was as much about Jon’s emotional and physical journey through that battle as anything else.
Watchers on the Wall is definitely the main part of the final chapter of Jon and Ygritte’s story, but it is also important in Sam and Gilly’s. Their story is told beautifully in that episode.
When I contemplate season eight, one hope I have for the major battle sequences is that they continue this human element. That they continue to be about not violence for the sake of violence, but of the cost of war both physically and emotionally.

You are so right. That sequence in the door is the most moving piece of television/film I have ever watched. I usually watch with my husband, but that one I watched alone and was therefore able to unashamedly weep. And weep I did! Nothing but GOT could wring the tears out of you while simultaneously pulling off an action heavy sequence at the same time. That example was spot on.

So true! When you consider the sheer complexity of the story, and adapting something like that to the screen, there are so many ways this could have gone horribly wrong. And for the few missteps there have been along the way, we have so many classic and memorable moments to be thankful for!

Ten Bears,
Ah, I see as BoB as GoT’s greatest battle sequence to date, but I do agree that Hardome was amazing. For me, that was all about the suspense and horror. With the scrabbling horde of dead and the unearthly ice monsters, it was like a nightmare come to life. The only respite we get from the relentless terror is when Jon is on his knees and coughing up blood, the Night’s King observing from him above.
It’s only afterwards when Jon, Tormund, Edd and the rest are on the boat that we get a sense of their overwhelming sadness as they watch the massacre of the remaining free folk. And then it’s back to abject fear again when the Night’s King locks eyes with Jon and shows the terrifying extent of his power – and how sincerely fucked Westeros is. That battle, though seemingly inconsequential in terms of the stakes as opposed to say, Blackwater, was just as much as a game changer plot wise. Another remarkable piece of television.

And the other parts of the episode – before those last twenty minutes – were excellent too. (Tyrion-Dany conversations, etc.)

All of this! I love Hardhome, it is one of my faves, and to me it encapsulates the entire series (battle for power, but, yeah, there is an army of dead people coming for everyone) and it shows the human side of conflict. There are those – like Loboda – who are uncertain about Jon and his motives, but who fight with him when the true threat comes.
And you are correct – it is the character moments that make it. The action bits are nothing without them.

Firannion: ut it still makes me a little nervous that the end product will prove inadequately lit for the viewer with anything less than a gigantic TV screen with easily accessible brightness control.
For good or for ill, it seems that most major TV series now work on the assumption that people will be watching shows this way. So, they are produced like movies. As a result, I find that most TV shows (just like most movies) are best viewed in dark rooms.

Hodors Bastard: I still believe the big battle episode(s) and aftermath will be performed as an opera. Wagner, eat your heart out. (Djawadi, therein lies the challenge…Götterdämmerung!)
Hmmm: will we get the great moments or the awful half-hours? 😀
Seriously, though: we really do need the musical episode at some point. I want to see Sophie Turner sing “I’m so pretty…” while mincing about the ramparts of Winterfell as the Night King rides down….

Nice! Imagine making one’s living being a location scout. Sounds like immense fun, but challenging in terms of logistics. When I’m hiking I not infrequently pass through spots that seem to belong in some sort of movie (usually fantasy genre), but then I have to consider how costly it would be to get cast, crew and equipment that far from a road. And maybe that’s partly why such sites manage to retain their magical look and feel. (I suppose I have this topic on my mind this week because the rail trail bridge that figures prominently in ‘A Quiet Place’ is a place that I have visited many, many times.)
I’m pleased to see that ‘Baby Driver’ also won one of these location awards. Some small compensation for getting skunked at the Oscars, where I thought it would waltz off with all the awards for editing, sound editing and sound mixing.

Firannion,
It probably is better for all concerned if they just film those areas in which you hike and then use green screens to put the actors there.

With the closing finale of “Under Pressure,” I should think.
Of course, I would have ended last season with Tormund wandering across the wreckage of the Wall with a mandolin singing “All alone or in twos….”

Penny Douglas: I am completely in awe of all of the people who have made Game of Thrones. It is and always will be one of my most favorite shows. It will be epic and bittersweet for this last season. I am going to miss it when it’s over. Everyone is so talented that has worked on it. Gratitde to all who have worked so hard to entertain us over these years.
This! Perfectly stated.

Thank you, Luka, for putting the picture of the card back on there. At the time I scanned the article yesterday, there was a notice that the picture had been removed by Instagram. Actually seeing it makes all the difference. I hope the “producer types” filmed during the 55 grueling days – I’d love to see how the scenes were achieved. Those behind the scenes snippets of how the show is created are some of my favorite things. I love the before and after shots of the CGI and love love watching the crews at work putting the battle scenes together and taking them apart.
I don’t think we’ll have to worry about having a lot of “character to character” moments. As I watched the wights cross over the Wall, I was impressed by the sheer numbers of them. They are a swarm – I kind of envision Winterfell being beset from all sides by the advancing Army of the Dead, with different characters teamed up in defense of their place on the ramparts, or outside the gates of Winterfell, much like when the Wildings were besieging Castle Black from both the Wall side and the front gates.
There were so many memorable character interactions then: Sam and Pyp teaming up to shoot arrows, until Ygritte got Pyp; The action in the courtyard, with Janos Slynt lurking about the edges until he took refuge in the storage room with Gilly; Alliser Thorne’s semi apology/explanation to Jon for the his decision not to block the tunnel, then Thorne’s badass performance in the courtyard. He might have been a pr**k, but he was no coward. And Ten Bears pointed out in that excellent recap of Hardhome so many of the highlights. The only thing I’d add is when Jon and Tormund landed on the shores: Tormund “Do you trust me, Jon Snow?” Jon: “Does that make me a fool?”
Whatever, at Winterfell, I think we are in for some monumentally memorable interactions between characters, and more than a few tears. After all, almost every character remaining is beloved and/or redeemed somehow, except for Cersei, and it’s going to be a torment to lose any of them. (Damn, I might even shed a tear or two when Cersei bites the dust.) I think Grey Worm will have Unsullied at the front gate, maybe being aided by men from the Golden Company or even Beric or Jorah, while Jorah keeps a watchful eye on Dany flying overhead. Maybe Arya and Sansa will have a spot at another point, and surely Jon and Tormund will be on the ramparts flinging wights off and filling them with flaming arrows.
However it unfolds, all portents are of a masterpiece season in the making. I might even be so bold as to contradict the “producer types” and say that, yes, we will know how hard the cast and crew worked, and be ever grateful to them for it.

Some of the characters on your list should probably be considered dead at this point, such as Ellaria Sand, Syrio Forel, and Septa Unella, but I don’t know how technical you’re trying to get. They should probably be separated from your alive list and moved to a “presumed dead” list, but ymmv.

Ole,
Great list! The only thing is a bunch of them are book-only characters that won’t be in the show, so it is a bit odd to use this full list when thinking of remaining characters in the show. And the flip side of that (as I’m sure you know), some characters in the books are dead but aren’t dead in the show and vise versa.
That being said, it would be nearly impossible to make a list like this for book characters, but I believe the show-only character list would be much smaller. I see that the list is exactly 150 people long, so I’m guessing you just wanted to blend the show and books together to get to that number. But still, really cool list!

By SUI-LEE WEE and ELSIE CHENAPRIL 13, 2018
BEIJING — Deng Yufeng wanted to create art that prods people to question their lack of data privacy. What better way, he reasoned, than to buy the personal information of more than 300,000 Chinese people off the internet and display it in a public exhibition?
The police did not appreciate the irony.
Last week, the authorities in the Chinese city of Wuhan shut down Mr. Deng’s exhibition in a local museum after two days and told him that he was being investigated on suspicion of amassing the information through illegal means.
Mr. Deng’s project coincides with a growing debate about the lack of data privacy in China, where people are starting to push back against tech companies and their use of information. Online brokers regularly, and illegally, buy and sell personal information online. Chinese people are often bombarded with calls and text messages offering bank loans or home purchases that seem too personalized to be random.
Mr. Deng, a 32-year-old artist based in Beijing, said he hoped to get Chinese people to question that everyday scenario.

“When these nuisance text messages become a daily routine, we develop a habit of ignoring and avoiding these text messages in a numb state,” he said in a telephone interview. “This is actually the mental state of most people here: a state of helplessness.”

Last month, Robin Li, the chief executive of the search giant Baidu, set off a firestorm when he said that Chinese people were willing to trade privacy for convenience, safety and efficiency. In December, the software developer Qihoo 360 angered many internet users when a blogger discovered that the company was taking surveillance footage from restaurants and gyms in Beijing and broadcasting it without permission onto its platform.
The rising public anger is taking place amid a similar debate in the United States, over Facebook. But Beijing officials keep the volume lower because personal data is broadly available to another powerful constituency: the Chinese government. Tech companies cooperate with the police in handing over information, with few questions asked. Citizens are resigned to the fact that they are tracked by the government, and there is little pushback about the increased state of surveillance.
So six months ago, Mr. Deng started buying people’s information, using the Chinese messaging app QQ to reach sellers. He said that the data was easy to find and that he paid a total of $800 for people’s names, genders, phone numbers, online shopping records, travel itineraries, license plate numbers — at a cost at just over a tenth of a penny per person.
He said he knew he was breaking the law. He wanted to prove a point.
“Artists are not merely aesthetic creators,” Mr. Deng said. “In the very complicated state of our world today, we should also bear social responsibility.”
At his exhibition, called “346,000 Wuhan Citizens’ Secrets,” he printed the pieces of personal data on sheets of paper using a special liquid solution. The sheets were hung in neat rows and columns on a wall. Museumgoers could only see the data under a special light source, and key identifying details were redacted.

According to Mr. Deng, plainclothes police officers took him away on April 6, two days after his exhibition opened. They told him that he was being investigated for the buying of citizens’ information online and was barred from leaving Wuhan. When reached for comment, a Wuhan-based police officer from the station investigating the case said she did not know anything about it and hung up.
Under Chinese criminal law, Mr. Deng faces up to seven years in jail. But Raymond Wang, a lawyer who specializes in data security, said he believed it was unlikely that Mr. Deng would be sentenced because there were no “damaging consequences.”
Whether Mr. Deng’s exhibit will catch the attention of China’s leaders isn’t clear. But Legal Daily, an official, government-run publication, said Mr. Deng’s project showed how the existing laws on the protection of personal information were weak and enforcement was poor.

“The organizer’s purpose was to call for the protection of personal privacy, and he himself violated the law to purchase personal information,” the newspaper wrote in an opinion piece. “Due to the complexity of the plot, it will make for a lively legal lesson.”
The privacy project is just one of Mr. Deng’s many works of art touching on social issues. He has gone undercover to investigate the kidnappings of children, a major problem in China. He has also worked on a project on how people buy fake identification cards and guns.
Mr. Deng pointed out that the lack of data privacy was also a global problem.
With the help of volunteers, Mr. Deng sent about 10,000 text messages to the people whose information he used in the exhibition, inviting them to come.
One of them was not amused, according to Mr. Deng, responding back: “You’re sick.”

I just returned from an advanced benefit screening of WALL*E, and I want to be careful not to spill too much regarding the movie. I had the added privilege of watching the film at Pixar, which in and of itself, was amazing. This picture is not a cartoon; it is a film. In fact, it even has the LOOK of film. One of my complaints of more recent 3-D/CG animated films (not from Pixar) is that they all seem to look the same... clean lines, crisp colors, and very "virtual", for lack of a better term. WALL*E transcends the typical look of CG animation, and has a true to life "grit." The creators at Pixar are true artists, and are indeed masters of their craft. Not only are they masters of the technology, they are masters of telling a story. WALL*E is no exception. The best way to describe the film is as a science fiction, comedy, dramatic love story. WALL*E, as a character, has dimension, personality, and heart... pretty impressive given that he is essentially a trash compactor. It is true that there is little dialogue in this feature, but I personally did not feel it detracted from the story at all. WALL*E is very much a different Pixar film from it's previous features. I will be curious to see how it is received by others, but in my opinion, I think Pixar has stayed true to itself, demonstrating a commitment to telling great stories and pushing the edge of technology to leave your jaw dropping! My most sincere compliments to Andrew Stanton, Jim Morris, John Lasseter, Ben Burtt, and all the creative forces at Pixar. Can't wait to see what the future brings...

President Trump, who repeatedly insisted during the 2016 campaign that Mexico would pay for a wall along the southern border, is privately pushing the U.S. military to fund construction of his signature project.
Trump has told advisers that he was spurned in a large spending bill last week when lawmakers appropriated only $1.6 billion for the border wall. He has suggested to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and congressional leaders that the Pentagon could fund the sprawling project, citing a “national security” risk.
After floating the notion to several advisers last week, Trump told House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) that the military should pay for the wall, according to three people familiar with the meeting last Wednesday in the White House residence. Ryan offered little reaction to the idea, these people said, but senior Capitol Hill officials later said it was an unlikely prospect.
The president’s pursuit of defense dollars to finance the U.S.-Mexico border wall underscores his determination to fulfill a campaign promise and build the barrier despite resistance in the Republican-led Congress. The administration’s last-minute negotiations with lawmakers to secure billions more for the wall failed, and Trump grudgingly signed the spending bill Friday after a short-lived veto threat.
Four days later, Trump continued to express regret over signing the $1.3 trillion package, which funded the government and averted a shutdown, saying it was a mistake and he should have followed his instincts.
In another interaction with senior aides last week, Trump noted that the Defense Department was getting so much money as part of the spending bill that the Pentagon could surely afford the border wall, two White House officials said. The Pentagon received about $700 billion in the spending package, which Trump repeatedly lauded as “historic.”
Meanwhile, the $1.6 billion in the bill for some fencing and levees on the border not only fell far short of the $25 billion that Trump was seeking, but it also came with tight restrictions on how the money could be spent.
The individuals and officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely about private discussions.
[Trump signs massive spending bill, but not before a little drama]
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders deflected a question Tuesday about money dedicated to the military being used to fund construction of the wall.
“I can’t get into the specifics of that at this point, but I can tell you that the continuation of building the wall is ongoing, and we’re going to continue moving forward in that process,” Sanders told reporters.
“Build WALL through M!” Trump recently wrote on Twitter. He retweeted those words Tuesday, noting that “our Military is again rich.” Two advisers said “M” stood for “military.”
The president has suggested to Mattis that his department, instead of the Department of Homeland Security, could fund the construction, two Trump advisers said. But the military is not likely to fund the wall, according to White House and Defense Department officials.
The Pentagon has plenty of money, but reprogramming it for a wall would require votes in Congress that the president does not seem to have. Taking money from the 2018 budget for the wall would require an act of Congress, a senior Pentagon official said.
To find the money in the 2019 defense budget, Trump would have to submit a budget amendment that would require 60 votes in the Senate, the official said.
Democrats in Congress would probably chafe at military spending going to the construction of a border wall, and military officials may also blanch, White House advisers said.
Defense hawks in the Republican ranks would balk at taking money now dedicated to the Pentagon for aircraft, weapons and improvements to the armed forces’ readiness and instead steering it toward construction of the wall.
“First Mexico was supposed to pay for it, then U.S. taxpayers, and now our men and women in uniform?” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement to The Washington Post. “This would be a blatant misuse of military funds and tied up in court for years. Secretary Mattis ought not bother and instead use the money to help our troops, rather than advance the president’s political fantasies.”
Trump has grown frustrated watching constant TV criticism of the spending package and is determined to find a new way to fund the wall, several advisers said, privately grousing that his political supporters could become disenchanted without progress. After a recent trip to see prototypes of the wall in California, Trump has grown more animated by the issue, advisers said.
The president’s comments raising the possibility of using Pentagon funds to build the wall came after the collapse of negotiations with Democrats to secure $25 billion in long-term wall funding in exchange for protections for young immigrants at risk for deportation because of Trump’s cancellation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
The White House offered three years of protections for DACA recipients, according to multiple congressional aides, but Democrats demanded protections for a larger group of “dreamers,” including those who never applied or are ineligible for DACA. The negotiations fell apart before the spending bill was drafted and passed last week.
[‘Trump blew it’: The president missed his best chance yet to get funding for his border wall]
The urgency to strike a deal reflected the growing sense that the spending bill represented the last chance for the Trump administration to secure substantial wall funding, at least in the president’s first term. Top Republicans believe it is all but certain that Democrats will gain House seats in November’s midterm elections — and perhaps take the majority — greatly enhancing their bargaining position in future spending negotiations.
Only $641 million is earmarked for new primary fencing in areas that have no barriers, and most of the money can be spent only on “operationally effective designs” that were deployed as of last May. That means the prototype designs the Trump administration is exploring cannot be built, except along a stretch of the border near San Diego where a barrier is already in place.
