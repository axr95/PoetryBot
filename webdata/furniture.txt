Furniture
When it comes to furnishing your home, finding the perfect furniture that is both stylish and functional is one of the best parts about owning a home. You can let your inner interior designer flourish sorting through all the decoration options, deciding on how to blend colors, patterns, and materials. With such variety in home furniture, it's important to know the differences between these styles and materials so you can find what works best for you. For instance, will Victorian furniture fit in with your design if you want to create a vibrant room with bright colors and contrasting highlights? Or does it make more sense to use a brighter theme and utilize coastal furniture to accomplish your goals? We'll try to go over all these details here so you can get on your way to finding the best home furniture for you. You can also shop furniture on Wayfair during our special promotion going on right now with TLC's Trading Spaces.
Furniture Styles
There are many styles that you can use and combine to create the aesthetic look that you want. From coastal to modern to Victorian home furniture styles can literally come in any shape or color. So how do you decide what style works best for you? It comes down to how you want to present your home. If you live near a beach and want to have a coastal style you can blend your coastal furniture, which are generally wickers and bright colored couches with light blue walls and yellow highlights.
Or if you want a more traditional look, Victorian furniture might fit your style more effectively. This furniture type is usually made from dark, solid wood and features classic designs. You can blend Victorian furniture with darker walls and different colored finishes of wood to have a complete home design. Finally, modern furniture is the most recent style. Modern furniture features simple, clean lines and is most commonly finished in black or white to create a minimalist look.
Furniture Materials
Lastly you need to decide what material you prefer the most for your furniture. Each material has its own benefits ranging from durability to aesthetic design to portability. For example, if you want a coffee table that is both light and easy to move, acrylic furniture is a fantastic option because it has both of those qualities. Metal is another fantastic material because it will last a long time and there are plenty of design options to choose from because of this materials popularity. With the combination of its sheen and the versatility with which it can be shaped, metal is a great option to look into as well. Your material selection isn't limited to only acrylic furniture and metal, you can find glass, marble, or wood in abundance here at Wayfair. So feel free to mix and match as you wish in order to design your room the way you want.

Discover the perfect blend of design and function with furniture that suits your individual taste and complements your life. Whatever your style—modern, rustic or traditional—find sofas, loveseats, tables and more. Decorate any room of your house, apartment, townhouse or condo with home furnishings in materials that blend with existing decor.
Create a comfortable living or family room with furniture that works as hard as you do. Curl up on the couch with a good book, or play a board game on the coffee table. Add side tables and media consoles to hold your drinks and your electronics. Want more seating for parties or big families? Consider a sectional sofa, extra chairs or even ottomans to make the most of your space. To increase the lifespan of your furniture, look for long-wearing and durable materials, including solid wood, leather and upholstery.
We spend a third of our lives sleeping, so it's important to find bedroom furniture that helps us rest and recharge. Easily store clothing, bed linens and other necessities in dressers, nightstands and armoires. A wood or metal bed frame provides traditional appeal and supports a quality mattress and boxspring set. For a modern look, consider an upholstered headboard or a platform bed.
Kitchens and dining rooms are often the central hub for the contemporary home. Kitchen carts and islands provide convenient storage and extra surface area for preparing meals. Create a cohesive aesthetic for dinner parties and meals at home with dining sets, including tables, buffets and sideboards. Add seating with dining chairs and benches. Looking for custom design? Create your own dining table by mixing and matching tabletops and bases until you find the perfect fit for your space.
Use high-quality furniture to showcase your individual style in home offices, entryways and hallways. Place a console table and a bench in the entryway to give guests a place to remove their shoes and set keys, packages or purses. Configure a home office with desks, cabinets and bookshelves that offer storage and the ability to work from home. To easily rearrange the room at a moment's notice, choose furniture with casters.
